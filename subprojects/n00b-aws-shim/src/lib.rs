//! n00b-aws-shim — Rust cdylib that exposes aws-sdk-rust operations
//! to libn00b_aws through a stable C ABI.
//!
//! Build the cdylib (`cargo build --release`), then point libn00b_aws
//! at the resulting `target/release/libn00b_aws_shim.{dylib,so,dll}`.
//! At build time meson runs `dsymutil` (macOS) and `~/slop/bin/demangle`
//! against the cdylib to produce a C header full of typed `extern`
//! declarations; libn00b_aws includes that header and link-time-links
//! against this dylib via `-ln00b_aws_shim`.
//!
//! ABI rules in this crate:
//!
//!   * Every public symbol is `#[no_mangle] extern "C" fn`. Internal
//!     helpers stay private and do not appear in the cdylib's exports.
//!   * All public symbols share the `n00b_aws_shim_` prefix so the
//!     dynamic-linker namespace is unambiguous.
//!   * No panics ever cross the FFI boundary — `panic = "abort"` in
//!     `Cargo.toml` makes every panic terminate the process rather
//!     than reach C code. Recoverable conditions are returned as
//!     status codes (the `N00B_AWS_SHIM_*` enum in C-land).
//!   * Heap state allocated on this side is freed through a matching
//!     `n00b_aws_shim_*_free` entry-point; the n00b GC proxies that
//!     through `n00b_add_finalizer`. The C++-style placement-new /
//!     manual-destructor dance is gone — pure malloc/free across the
//!     FFI, owned and managed in Rust.
//!
//! Phase 3c first wrap — STS GetCallerIdentity. Once you sign off on
//! the pattern, the same shape extends to every aws-sdk-* operation
//! across SQS / SNS / S3 / etc.
