# ObjC compiler/linker wrapper that injects the GC type-map dictionary.
#
# WHY: ncc compiles every n00b C TU with --ncc-gcmap-prelink, emitting raw,
# dependency-free `n00b_gcraw` records (instead of typed codegen-ABI structs —
# that decoupling is what stops minor edits to include/core/codegen_abi.h from
# rebuilding the whole tree). Those raw records must be aggregated, per final
# executable, into one generated object defining the typed n00b_gcmap_table[] /
# n00b_gcmap_count that the runtime binary-searches (src/core/gc_type_map.c).
#
# ncc normally does this at its own link stage, but in this build the executables
# are linked by the ObjC linker (libn00b.a contains the Cocoa ObjC bridge, so
# meson selects the ObjC compiler as the clink driver), NOT by ncc. So we slot
# this wrapper in as the ObjC compiler/linker (via OBJC=...):
#   * ObjC COMPILE step (`-c`, or a .m/.mm input): transparently exec the real
#     Apple clang — we touch nothing.
#   * LINK step: run `ncc --ncc-gcmap-emit` over the link's object/archive inputs
#     (which include every one of this executable's own TUs AND libn00b.a, so the
#     dictionary is complete and per-executable-correct), then exec the real
#     Apple clang link with the original args plus the generated dictionary
#     object appended.
#
# Scanning an archive means extracting and reading every member, and libn00b.a
# contributes the same records to all ~600 executables. The meson `n00b-gcraw`
# target extracts those records once into `libn00b.gcraw`; where an archive has
# such a blob beside it, and the blob is not older than the archive, the blob
# goes to gcmap-emit in the archive's place. The emitted dictionary is identical
# either way. An archive with no blob, or a stale one, is scanned as before.
#
# Required environment:
#   NCC_GCMAP_REAL_OBJC   absolute path to the real ObjC compiler (Apple clang)
#   NCC_GCMAP_NCC         absolute path to ncc
#   NCC_GCMAP_INCLUDE     include dir for the generated TU's #include "core/codegen_abi.h"
#
# If any are unset, the wrapper degrades to a transparent passthrough to the real
# compiler (the build still works; typed allocations fall back to conservative
# scanning, which is GC-safe).
set -euo pipefail

# Resolve configuration from the environment when present (set by build.sh), but
# fall back to deriving everything from the wrapper's own location so a direct
# `ninja` run (no build.sh env) still aggregates the dictionary rather than
# silently degrading. This matters because src/core/gc_type_map.c references the
# dictionary symbols directly: if the dict object is not linked, the link FAILS.
