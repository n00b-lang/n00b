/*
 * Predicate rewriting, between lowering and planning.
 *
 * Lowering is a structural transcription: whatever shape a caller wrote is the
 * shape the planner gets. That is the right contract for filter.c, which has
 * no business deciding that two conditions are the same condition, but it
 * leaves the planner reading the query's spelling rather than its meaning. A
 * generated filter names one condition many times, writes an equality list as
 * a disjunction, and nests groups that flatten; none of that changes what
 * matches, and all of it changes what gets read.
 *
 * This pass sits in between and answers only questions about the predicate
 * itself. It touches no shard, no index and no catalog, so it runs before any
 * of them are consulted and its result is good for every shard the query will
 * reach.
 *
 * Rule 3 in plan.h governs everything here: cost may change, answers may not.
 * Every rewrite below is an equivalence, not an approximation, and the two
 * places that could tempt otherwise are called out where they sit: an
 * incomparable pair of values is left alone rather than guessed at, and a
 * regex is compared by identity rather than by pattern.
 *
 * What it does
 * ------------
 *
 *   flatten        AND(a, AND(b, c))            -> AND(a, b, c)
 *   absorb         AND(a, FALSE)                -> FALSE
 *                  OR(a, TRUE)                  -> TRUE
 *                  AND(a, TRUE)                 -> a
 *                  OR(a, FALSE)                 -> a
 *   dedupe         AND(a, b, a)                 -> AND(a, b)
 *   contradict     AND(a, NOT a)                -> FALSE
 *                  OR(a, NOT a)                 -> TRUE
 *   double negate  NOT(NOT a)                   -> a
 *   range merge    AND(x in [3,9], x in [5,20]) -> x in [5,9]
 *                  AND(x in [1,2], x in [8,9])  -> FALSE
 *   eq conflict    AND(x = 1, x = 2)            -> FALSE
 *                  AND(x = 1, x in [5,9])       -> FALSE
 *   in collapse    OR(x = 1, x = 2, x = 3)      -> x IN (1, 2, 3)
 *   factor         OR(AND(a,b), AND(a,c))       -> AND(a, OR(b,c))
 *
 * The last two are the ones with teeth.
 *
 * Collapsing a disjunction of equalities is what makes the IN fan-out cap mean
 * something. `field IN (v1..vN)` and the written-out OR of N equalities plan to
 * the same union (plan.h), but only the IN spelling was measured against
 * ROCS_PLAN_IN_FANOUT_MAX, so the same query written the other way built a
 * union of any width at all. Collapsing first means there is one spelling by
 * the time the cap is applied, and the cap applies to both.
 *
 * Factoring is worth more than it looks. The distributed form runs the shared
 * conjunct once per branch against the whole shard; the factored form runs it
 * once and every branch after it sees only what it selected. That is the same
 * accumulator effect the planner's operand ordering is for, except no ordering
 * can produce it: in the distributed form the shared work is two separate
 * subtrees, and nothing may reorder one into the other.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * Negation normal form. Pushing NOT down to the leaves would make more
 * subterms syntactically comparable, and it would also turn COMPLEMENT over
 * one intersection into a union of two complements, which reads more postings
 * for the same answer. The analysis that wants NNF is done without rewriting
 * to it: contradiction detection looks through a NOT rather than moving it.
 *
 * Common subexpression elimination across branches that do not factor. Two OR
 * branches naming the same expensive leaf read its posting list twice, and
 * sharing it would need the plan to be a DAG with a result cache rather than a
 * tree. Factoring covers the cases where the shared term is a conjunct of
 * every branch, which is the shape that shows up in generated queries.

// A group wider than this is left unfactored and undeduped.
//
// Both walks compare every operand against every other, so both are quadratic
// in the group's width, and a rewrite that costs more than the read it saves
// is not a saving. The cap matches ROCS_PLAN_IN_FANOUT_MAX and
// ROCS_COST_ORDER_MAX at 64 rather than picking a third number: past that
// width the planner has already decided the group is wide enough to read
// records over, and narrowing a plan nobody will use is wasted work.
//
// Absorption, flattening and the IN collapse are linear and stay on at any
// width, which matters because the width is exactly what the IN collapse is
// there to bound.

// A ceiling on rounds, reached by nothing and asserted against.
//
// One rewrite enables another: factoring produces an AND that wants
// flattening, flattening exposes duplicate conjuncts, deduping can leave a
// one-child group that folds to its operand. Rather than order the rules so
// one pass suffices, which is a proof obligation every future rule would
// inherit, the pass runs until a round changes nothing.
//
// That terminates because every rule strictly decreases the pair
//
//     (leaf occurrences, node count)
//
// read lexicographically. Dedupe, absorption, the IN collapse, range merging
// and both contradiction folds remove leaf occurrences outright. Flattening
// keeps them and removes a group node. Factoring is the one worth checking:
// it can leave the node count equal, as `OR(AND(a,b,c), AND(a,d,e))` does,
// but it removes k-1 copies of each hoisted conjunct, so the first component
// falls. No rule increases either, and neither can fall below zero.
//
// So the loop below is a fixpoint iteration with a proof, and the cap is a
// guard against a future rule that breaks the measure rather than a budget
// anything spends. Hitting it means such a rule now exists, which is a bug in
// that rule and not a predicate to truncate: a debug build says so, and a
// release build stops rewriting rather than spinning.
