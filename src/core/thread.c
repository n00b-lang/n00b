// Minimal n00b-owned per-thread TCB / platform-ABI TSD (D-021).
//
// A raw OS worker starts with a zero thread-pointer register.  Any code
// that reads the thread pointer then faults:
//
//   - macOS arm64: os_unfair_lock / _os_nospin_lock_lock execute
//       mrs x9, TPIDRRO_EL0  ;  ldr w3, [x9, #0x18]  ;  casa ...
//     i.e. they load a 32-bit owner token from slot 3 of the TSD
//     (offset 0x18 == __TSD_MACH_THREAD_SELF * 8); cerror stores errno at
//     slot 1 (offset 0x08 == __TSD_ERRNO).  Verified by disassembly of
//     _os_nospin_lock_lock and the XNU/libpthread TSD slot layout
//     (libsyscall os/tsd.h: __TSD_THREAD_SELF=0, __TSD_ERRNO=1,
//     __TSD_MACH_THREAD_SELF=3).  The slot-3 token is the thread's Mach
//     port (NOT merely a self port — confirmed against a live worker:
//     [TSD+0x18] held the thread_create port, low bit reserved for the
//     lock's "has waiters" flag).
//   - Linux: glibc locks/errno read the thread pointer via %fs.
//
// D-021 resolution: n00b installs its OWN minimal TSD block at worker
// entry so these primitives operate.  On macOS this is done with the
// `_thread_set_tsd_base` machdep trap (x16=0x80000000, x3=2 ->
// thread_set_cthread_self -> machine_thread_set_tsd_base), which lets a
// running Mach thread set its OWN TPIDRRO_EL0 to our block — keeping the
// existing Mach thread_create + thread_set_state path and avoiding both
// the Mach-thread "RO thread pointer" limitation AND libpthread bring-up.
// (bsdthread_create was the originally-named mechanism in D-021 but is
// NOT viable here: the kernel rejects a non-PTHREAD_START_CUSTOM call with
// EINVAL, and a CUSTOM call jumps the child into libpthread's
// process-registered thread_start trampoline — we do not control the PC —
// which runs _pthread_start expecting a real, libpthread-initialized
// pthread_t.  The machdep trap is the off-libpthread primitive that gives
// the SAME result: the kernel sets our thread pointer.  Verified
// empirically: a Mach thread that installs a minimal block this way runs
// os_unfair_lock lock/unlock repeatedly without faulting.)
//
// The block is one zeroed page (so any slot libsystem indexes is mapped
// and zero) mapped via n00b_mmap from a non-GC region; the REAPER frees it
// at OS-confirmed death (WP-3a Phase 2 / D-034 — _n00b_reap_reclaim ->
// _n00b_tcb_free; NOT the joiner, which frees nothing under D-034).  It
// carries no n00b per-thread data (identity stays the stack ID
// word per D-014/D-019; n00b state stays in n00b_thread_t per D-005/D-012)
// — only the platform-ABI slots above.
//
// The worker still keeps its FOUNDATION syscalls TSD-independent: the
// futex WAKE is a direct svc syscall (core/futex.h) and the worker's EXIT
// is a direct bsdthread_terminate (below).  Those run both before and
// after the TSD is torn down on macOS, so they must not depend on it.

//  `ldur x11, [x10, #-0x30]` with x10 = TPIDRRO_EL0.  The `b.hs` at +16 takes
//  the page-probe path only when SP has already grown PAST the top (SP >=
//  [tp-0x30]); a normal downward-growing stack has SP < top, so it falls
//  through to the [tp-0x28] limit check at +20.)  A raw worker crashed in
// exactly this path: arc4random_buf's periodic DRBG *reseed*

// *generate* path has small frames, never calls ___chkstk_darwin, and so never
// reads these fields — which is why random worked everywhere else and only the
// (intermittent) reseed faulted.
//
// So the TCB thread pointer is placed at a fixed offset INTO the page (not at
// the base), leaving room below for these fields — mirroring how real

// gate (stack_lo then stack_hi then thread = nullptr) on the worker's own exit
// path, releasing the slot for reuse, and n00b_thread_init bumps the generation
// when a slot is (re)acquired.  Having the reaper re-clear the slot would be a
