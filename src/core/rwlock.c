/*
 * Futex-based reader-writer lock implementation.
 *
 * The futex word encodes both the reader count (low 30 bits) and the
 * writer-lock bit (bit 30, N00B_RW_W_LOCK).  Writers set the W_LOCK bit
 * to block new readers, then wait for the reader count to reach zero.
 *
 * Reader-to-writer upgrade is supported: the upgrading reader first
 * decrements the reader count (to avoid self-deadlock), then competes
 * for the write bit normally.

// A thread holds the STW gate (critical_execution) across its WHOLE init, but
// it must take that hold BEFORE its TCB (thread->record) exists —
// n00b_thread_self() is not resolvable until the live-slot bitmap is published
// partway through init.  So the outer acquire rides the null-self reader path:
// it bumps the raw futex reader count but registers no read-log record.  Once
// the slot is published and n00b_thread_self() resolves, any NESTED gate
// acquire (the first GC-visible allocation -> mmap lookup, etc.) runs with
// have_tcb == true and consults the read log to recognize its own outstanding
// hold.  Finding no record, it would attempt a FRESH acquire and block behind a
// writer that has set W_LOCK — a writer that is itself draining for this very
// thread's outstanding reader count.  Classic reader-recursion-vs-writer
// deadlock (and exactly the soak hang observed: collector at the write-lock
// drain, the mid-init thread blocked re-acquiring the gate it already holds).
//
// Adoption closes the gap: the instant the TCB resolves, materialize a read-log
// record for the already-held count (level 1 = the one outstanding futex unit).
// Subsequent nested acquires then take the reentrant fast path (no futex
// touch); their unlocks drain the record level first, dropping the futex count
// only when the outermost hold is released.  Net futex effect is unchanged —
// the hold is simply now visible to reentrancy.  Idempotent: a no-op if a
// record for this lock already exists.
