/**
 * @file synthetic_idp.h
 * @brief In-process synthetic IdP fixture for offline auth testing.
 *
 * Phase 3.10: lets unit tests exercise the full Phase 3 stack
 * (OIDC discovery → JWKS → JWT verify → policy eval) without
 * standing up a real IdP container.
 *
 * Shape:
 *   - Generates an ephemeral ES256 keypair on construct.
 *   - Issues a known JWKS document containing that key.
 *   - Mints tokens with caller-specified claims via a single
 *     helper.
 *   - Bridges into n00b_oidc_t via `n00b_oidc_open_with_jwks` —
 *     no HTTP server, no port binding.
 *
 * The fixture lives under test/ and is shared by Phase 3.10's
 * end-to-end test plus any future tests that want a "real-ish"
 * IdP without Docker.  The Keycloak interop fixture for fully
 * realistic testing lives at test/fixtures/keycloak/.
