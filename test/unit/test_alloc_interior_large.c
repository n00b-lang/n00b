/*
 * test_alloc_interior_large.c — n00b#321.
 *
 * A GC stack root may hold an INTERIOR pointer: n00b_visit_possible_pointer
 * (gc.c) explicitly retries n00b_find_alloc_info with .scan_for_header = true
 * when the exact lookup misses, and n00b_translate_pointer forwards
 * offset-preserving. So interior roots are a supported contract, and the
 * collector's ability to resolve one back to its allocation is what makes
 * them safe.
 *
 * That resolution is a backward scan for the allocation's guard word, and it
 * has to be bounded -- a conservative candidate that is NOT a pointer has no
 * guard behind it, and an unbounded walk to the segment start would livelock
 * the collector on a large arena.
 *
 * The bound used to be a flat 8 MB. Past that the scan gave up SHORT of a
 * live object's guard, and a failed resolution is indistinguishable from
 * "this address is free space": the visit path drops the root, so the object
 * is neither marked nor forwarded while a live root still points into it.
 * The next dereference reads a stale address -- non-null, heap-shaped, and
 * fatal. Downstream (crashappsec/wax#674) that surfaced as a SIGSEGV on the
 * first load after a safepoint.
 *
 * This test walks interior offsets across that old boundary. It is a
 * regression test for the bound, not for the 8 MB number: the point is that
 * resolution must not depend on how far into an allocation a pointer lands.
