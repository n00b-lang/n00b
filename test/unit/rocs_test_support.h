// Shards built by a store allocate from its hot pool, configured exactly as
// below: hidden, inline headers, no external metadata. Inline headers keep the
// allocations resolvable by n00b_find_alloc_info, and the pool never moves, so
// the rwlocks guarding a shard's lists stay put while a futex wait is keyed on
// their address. A shard built with no allocator would get the default moving
// heap instead. Tests should exercise the memory model production uses.
// The pool itself is heap allocated rather than a file-scope static, because a
// shard keeps a pointer to its allocator and sealing marshals that pointer. An
// address in .bss is static memory with no registered static object behind it,
// which the marshaller refuses. Heap memory is absent from the mmap tree, so
// the pointer scan passes over it, and that is what production does too: a
// store embeds its pool in a heap-allocated struct.
