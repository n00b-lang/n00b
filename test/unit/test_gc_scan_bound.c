/*
 * test_gc_scan_bound.c — n00b#275 and n00b#395.
 *
 * Both issues are about the same loop: the conservative backward guard scan in
 * _find_sentinal (alloc.c), which the mark loop reaches once per candidate
 * pointer that lands inside a heap mapping without being at an allocation
 * base. Two things decided how expensive that loop was, and each is asserted
 * here rather than timed, so the checks mean the same thing on a loaded CI
 * box as on an idle laptop.
 *
 * n00b#275 -- the loop's PER-PAGE COST. The scan asks
 * n00b_check_memory_perms once per page it walks. That answers from the
 * registry only when the mapping's record states its permissions; otherwise it
 * falls through to a pipe write() + poll() (plus, before n00b#384, a
 * process-global signal() per call). Arena segments registered as
 * perms_unknown, so every page of every backward walk over the GC heap paid
 * three syscalls. n00b#275 measured 84% of _n00b_find_alloc_info's samples
 * inside syscalls on a gateway that was stopped-the-world for 90.4% of wall
 * clock. Check: an arena segment's record states rw.
 *
 * n00b#395 -- the loop's LENGTH. The bound was a MONOTONIC all-time
 * high-water mark of a single allocation, process-global. One large
 * allocation therefore raised the cost of every later probe for the remaining
 * life of the process, including after that allocation was freed, and
 * including candidates in mappings that never held anything but small
 * objects. The bound is now taken per mapping. Check: after a large
 * allocation dies, a mapping holding only small live objects reports a small
 * bound while the global high-water is still large.
 *
 * The safety property the tighter bound must not break -- an interior pointer
 * must still resolve back to its own allocation, however far into it the
 * pointer lands -- is n00b#321, and test_alloc_interior_large.c is its
 * regression test. This file re-checks it against the per-mapping bound,
 * because that is the bound n00b#321's failure would now come from.
