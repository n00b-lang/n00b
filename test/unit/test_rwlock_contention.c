/*
 * test_rwlock_contention.c — Minimal repro for the rwlock deadlock
 * surfaced while wiring locking into the HTTP connection pool.
 *
 * Hypothesis: mixed reader/writer traffic on n00b_rwlock_t deadlocks
 * deterministically within tens of iterations on 4 threads.
 *
 * This test deliberately uses the rwlock directly with NO pool / NO
 * GC-allocated origins / NO containers — just a stack-allocated lock
 * and a shared counter — so any deadlock we see is purely a rwlock
 * problem.
