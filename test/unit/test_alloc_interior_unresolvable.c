/*
 * test_alloc_interior_unresolvable.c — n00b#327.
 *
 * n00b_find_alloc_info(.scan_for_header = true) promises to resolve an
 * interior pointer back to its allocation. It delivers that by scanning
 * backward for an inline header's sentinel, which an allocator with OOB
 * metadata and NO inline headers does not have. The OOB metadata dict is
 * keyed by the exact allocation base (core/oob_md_dict.h), so an interior
 * address just misses.
 *
 * That miss used to be reported as n00b_alloc_err — the identical answer to
 * "this address is in free space", which conservative stack scanning
 * produces constantly (gc.c's visit path treats it as nothing-to-do). The
 * two are not the same: free space means there is nothing to mark, whereas
 * an unresolvable interior pointer may be the only reference to a live
 * object, and dropping it lets the post-mark sweep reclaim that object
 * while a live root still points into it.
 *
 * This test pins the distinction. It does NOT assert that interior
 * resolution works for this allocator shape — it cannot, and #327 records
 * why: that needs a "greatest base <= addr" lookup and the metadata is an
 * unordered hash dict.
 *
 * .alloc_refcount is the way to get this shape: pool.c forces
 * external_metadata on and inline_headers off for it.
