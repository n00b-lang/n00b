/**
 * @file aws/n00b_aws.h
 * @brief Public umbrella for libn00b_aws.
 *
 * libn00b_aws is the n00b-idiomatic wrap over `n00b-aws-shim`, a
 * Rust cdylib that re-exports aws-sdk-rust operations as
 * `extern "C"`. See [[project_n00b_aws_via_rust_shim]] in the SKP
 * auto-memory for why we use aws-sdk-rust instead of aws-sdk-cpp.
 *
 * Build it with `-Denable_aws=true` (or `N00B_BUILD_AWS=1` to
 * `build.sh`). Programs that don't use AWS pay zero build cost.
 *
 * Coverage rule: every public Operation in each service's Smithy
 * model has a wrapper here, including the long tail. The first
 * service in is STS — see `<aws/n00b_aws_sts.h>` for the surface.
