 * Exposes a single synchronous round-trip primitive: connect a TCP
 * socket to host:port, run a TLS-1.3 handshake (validating the peer
 * cert through `acme_trust_*.c`), send `request` over the encrypted
 * channel, drain the response until the peer closes, return the
 * raw HTTP/1.1 response bytes.
 *
 * Bypasses the n00b conduit machinery deliberately — see acme_http.h
