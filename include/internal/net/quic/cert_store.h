/**
 * @file cert_store.h
 * @internal
 * @brief SNI-keyed cert store with hot-reload semantics.
 *
 * This is the data structure picotls's `sign_certificate` callback
 * consults during the TLS handshake.  Three guarantees:
 *
 *   - **Atomic swap**: a writer that calls `install` or `replace`
 *     publishes a complete new view in a single store-release; readers
 *     never see a partially-rebuilt store.
 *   - **No reader lock**: lookups go through one acquire-load on an
 *     `_Atomic(view_t *)` followed by a small linear scan; no mutex
 *     on the read path.
 *   - **No use-after-free for in-flight handshakes**: a handshake
 *     that captured the previous view continues to operate on it
 *     until the handshake completes.  Old views are retained in a
 *     graveyard so their entry pointers stay valid; the graveyard
 *     never shrinks across a single endpoint's lifetime, which keeps
 *     the structure simple.  Memory cost: one entry per swap, each
 *     a few dozen bytes — acceptable for cert renewals on the order
 *     of weeks.
 *
 * Wildcard rules (RFC 6125 § 6.4.3, simplified):
 *   - `"example.com"`            matches only `"example.com"`
 *   - `"*.example.com"`          matches one DNS label under
 *                                `example.com` (e.g.,
 *                                `"foo.example.com"` but not
 *                                `"foo.bar.example.com"`).
 *   - `"*"`                      matches anything (catch-all);
 *                                used as the last-resort fallback.
 *
 * Match precedence on lookup: exact > one-label wildcard > catch-all.
 *
 * @see ~/dd/quic_2.md § 6
