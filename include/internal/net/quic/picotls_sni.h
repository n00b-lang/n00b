/**
 * @file picotls_sni.h
 * @internal
 * @brief Wire a `n00b_quic_cert_store_t` into picotls's
 *        per-connection callbacks.
 *
 * Three callbacks make up the routing:
 *
 *   - `on_client_hello`: reads the SNI from the ClientHello,
 *     looks up the matching cert in the store, allocates a small
 *     per-cnx context struct that caches the DER iovec list +
 *     the signing key handle, registers it in a per-endpoint
 *     side table keyed on the `ptls_t *` (we don't use
 *     `ptls_get_data_ptr` because picoquic owns that slot for the
 *     `picoquic_cnx_t *`).
 *   - `emit_certificate`: looks up the per-cnx context, hands its
 *     iovecs to `ptls_build_certificate_message`.
 *   - `sign_certificate`: looks up the per-cnx context, signs via
 *     `n00b_quic_secret_sign(N00B_QUIC_SIG_ECDSA_P256)`, converts
 *     raw r||s to DER, writes to picotls's output buffer with
 *     `selected_algorithm = PTLS_SIGNATURE_ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256`.
 *
 * Per-cnx state lives in the conduit pool, indexed by `ptls_t *`
 * in the per-endpoint side table; entries are pruned in the
 * `picoquic_callback_close` hook driven by the n00b_quic_conn
 * default callback (see `n00b_quic_picotls_sni_cleanup_cnx`).
 *
 * Phase 2 audit-tail item #12: this is the wiring that turns the
 * cert_store data structure into actual per-cnx atomic SNI
 * routing — the multi-cert successor to the global
 * `picoquic_set_tls_certificate_chain`-based hot reload.
 *
 * @see ~/dd/quic_2.md § 6
