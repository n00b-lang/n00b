/**
 * @file http_url.h
 * @brief Internal URL parser for the n00b HTTP client (Phase 6, chunk 1).
 *
 * Parses absolute HTTPS URIs into a structured form the client layers
 * (`http_h1`, `http_h3`, `http_pool`, `http_alt_svc`) can route on
 * without re-tokenizing the input.  Scope follows
 * `~/dd/quic_6.md` § 2.1 — RFC 3986 with the relaxed real-world
 * conventions (port-less HTTPS defaults to 443; IPv6 literals in
 * `[…]`) — plus § 2.2: HTTPS-only, no userinfo.
 *
 * This header is **internal**: the URL parser is shared between the
 * h1 and h3 paths but is not part of the public n00b_http surface.
 * Operators interact with URLs through `n00b_http_request(url, ...)`
 * which performs the parse on their behalf.

 * All `n00b_string_t *` fields are allocated from the runtime default

 * MUST treat the struct as immutable after parse — write-back is not
 * supported.
 *
 * @c host         Host without IPv6 brackets.  For `https://[::1]:8443/`
 *                 this is `"::1"`, not `"[::1]"`.  Always pure ASCII
 *                 post-parse:
 *
 *                 - DNS-label hosts pass through UTS #46 ToASCII at
 *                   parse time (DF-X), so Unicode labels arrive as
 *                   `xn--…` Punycode.  Pure-ASCII labels are
 *                   byte-identical to their raw input modulo
 *                   UTS-46 case-folding (lowercased).
 *                 - IPv4 dotted-quads are a fixed point of UTS-46
 *                   (each octet `0-255` is a valid ASCII DNS label)
 *                   and survive unchanged.
 *                 - IPv6 literals bypass IDNA and are lowercased
 *                   per RFC 3986 § 3.2.2.
 *
 *                 Downstream consumers (allowlist matcher, cookie
 *                 jar, Host header, TLS SNI, `getaddrinfo`,
 *                 alt-svc) therefore see a canonical ACE-form host
 *                 without re-running IDNA themselves.
 * @c is_ipv6_literal  True iff the authority used the `[…]` form.
 * @c port              Effective port — explicit value if present,
 *                      otherwise 443 (the HTTPS default).
 * @c has_explicit_port True iff the URL spelled the port out.
 *                      Needed by the origin-canonicalization rule
 *                      (omit `:443` from the cache key).
 * @c path              Path with leading `/`.  Defaults to `"/"` when
 *                      the URL omits a path entirely.
 * @c query             Query without leading `?`.  Empty string if
 *                      no query was present.
 * @c origin            Canonical `https://host[:port]` for cache /
 *                      pool keys.  Port omitted iff
 *                      `has_explicit_port == false` OR
 *                      `port == 443`.  IPv6 hosts are re-bracketed
 *                      here (so the origin string is a parseable URL
 *                      prefix on its own).
