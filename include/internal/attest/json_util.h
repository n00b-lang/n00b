/** Look up a string-keyed entry in a parsed JSON object.
 *
 *  Walks the untyped-dict store under `obj` and returns the node
 *  whose key matches `key` (byte compare on the underlying UTF-8
 *  payload, no hashing). Returns `nullptr` if `obj` is null,
 *  `obj` is not a JSON object, the dict store is empty, or the
 *  key is absent.
 *
 *  The returned pointer aliases the parse tree — the caller must
 *  not free it independently. Callers typically pass `r"..."`
 *  rich-string literals for zero-allocation static keys.
