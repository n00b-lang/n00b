/**
 * Query planning: turning a predicate tree into a plan.
 *
 * n00b_plan_build takes a predicate and a shard's index descriptors and
 * returns a plan tree. It reads index metadata only and has no shard
 * parameter, so a plan can be built with no store open and one plan serves
 * every shard in a store.
 *
 *     filter                 callers build this, via rocs/filter.h
 *       |
 *       |  lowered by filter.c
 *       v
 *     predicate tree         AND / OR / NOT over leaves like eq or contains
 *       |
 *       |  n00b_plan_build   pick an index per leaf, then group
 *       v
 *     plan tree              INDEX_SCAN / RECORD_SCAN / INTERSECT / UNION /
 *       |                    COMPLEMENT / EMPTY
 *       |  n00b_plan_exec_*  eval.h: reads shards, cancellable
 *       v
 *     ordinals               positions of the records that match
 *
 * Both tree shapes live in plan_ir.h. Execution lives in eval.h.
 *
 * This is not a cost-based optimizer. There is exactly one plan for a given
 * predicate, and the only choice made is which index serves a leaf: every
 * descriptor is asked whether it accelerates (field, op), and the accelerating
 * one with the lowest selectivity hint wins. That hint does not depend on the
 * literal being searched, so the planner cannot tell a selective value from a
 * common one.
 *
 * What each leaf plans to:
 *
 *   eq                term index when one exists, else a record scan.
 *   contains, field   full-text index when one exists, else a record scan.
 *   contains, any     the catch-all index, or EMPTY. A record scan would match
 *                     fields the catch-all deliberately excludes.
 *   prefix, regex     n-gram index paired with the record scan that settles
 *                     it, else a record scan alone. Regex needs a literal
 *                     prefix to use an index at all.
 *   exists, in,
 *   range, under      record scan. No index path exists for these.
 *
 * Grouping. INTERSECT and UNION are associative, so a group nested inside a
 * group of the same kind is spliced into its parent, and the record scans in a
 * group merge into one. Both matter for cost rather than for answers: a flat
 * group lets execution resolve every index scan before any record scan runs,
 * so a scan sees only what its siblings already selected, and merging means a
 * group costs one pass over the records instead of one per unindexed leaf. A
 * group left holding a single operand is replaced by that operand, so building
 * an AND of two unindexed leaves yields a bare RECORD_SCAN.
 *
 * Three rules keep the split honest.
 *
 * 1. Planning touches no shard. n00b_plan_build has no shard parameter, so
 *    this is checkable rather than a convention. Reading records here would
 *    put unbounded work in the one phase with no cancel callback.
 *
 * 2. A plan describes work; it does not perform it. When the planner wants an
 *    operation the plan cannot express, extend the node vocabulary instead of
 *    doing the work. NOT over an indefinite child is the worked example: it
 *    cannot complement a maybe, so it plans COMPLEMENT and execution resolves
 *    it.
 *
 * 3. Cost may change; answers may not. An unusable index, a lossy scan that
 *    narrowed nothing, and a leaf with no index path all fall back to reading
 *    more records. None of them change which records match.
 *
 * This header is internal to the rocs planner and its focused tests. It is not
 * part of the public rocs umbrella and is not included by <rocs/n00b_rocs.h>.
 *
 * Predicate trees and ordinal sets are process-side state. They are never
 * shard marshal state, are not stored in n00b_store_shard_t, and must not be
 * embedded in sealed shard images. Nodes, sets and helper containers are
 * allocated through the caller-selected allocator and owned by that
 * allocator/GC lifetime; there is no explicit destroy API.
 *
 * The any-field target is accepted only for N00B_PLAN_LEAF_CONTAINS. It is
 * rejected for range, exists, under/path, prefix, regex, equality and IN.
