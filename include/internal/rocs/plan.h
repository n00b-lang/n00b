/**
 * @file internal/rocs/plan.h
 * @brief Internal process-side planner declarations for rocs.
 *
 * This header is internal to rocs planner implementation and focused tests.
 * It is not part of the public rocs umbrella, is not included by
 * <rocs/n00b_rocs.h>, and may change before the public filter/query APIs land.
 *
 * Predicate trees and ordinal sets declared here are process-side planning
 * state only. They are not shard marshal state, are not stored in
 * @c n00b_store_shard_t, and must not be embedded in sealed shard images. Nodes,
 * sets, and helper containers are allocated through the caller-selected
 * allocator and are owned by that allocator/GC lifetime; there is no explicit
 * destroy API.
 *
 * Ownership summary:
 * - Constructors return owned predicate/target/path handles on success.
 * - AND/OR constructors take logical ownership of the supplied child list on
 *   success. The caller must not mutate that list after a successful call.
 * - NOT takes logical ownership of its child predicate on success.
 * - Leaf targets are borrowed handles; they must outlive the predicate tree
 *   through the allocator/GC lifetime.
 * - Equality, IN, and range leaves store n00b variants over JSON node handles
 *   or lists of those variants. Contains/prefix, regex, and under/path leaves
 *   use their dedicated string, regex, and path handles. No payload-kind enum,
 *   cached value type, or parallel discriminator is stored; JSON node variant
 *   selectors and pointed-to object APIs remain authoritative for payload
 *   interpretation.
 * - Field targets retain the supplied field-name pointer. The any-field target
 *   is an internal catch-all marker, not a fake schema field string.
 * - Path handles copy component helper handles into an owned immutable list.
 *   Path component keys are borrowed string handles and must outlive the path
 *   through the allocator/GC lifetime.
 * - Ordinal sets own a dense internal bitset and carry an explicit per-shard
 *   universe @c 0..record_count-1. Boolean operations never cross shard
 *   universes and complement is defined only relative to the set's own
 *   @c record_count.
 * - Dispatch results own their candidate ordinal set. They may also retain an
 *   internal set of exact OR-branch matches that verification unions back after
 *   residual filtering; this keeps exact index matches from being re-evaluated
 *   by residual predicates that intentionally lack schema/index metadata.
 *   Residual predicates returned from dispatch accessors are borrowed handles:
 *   they may point into the original predicate tree or into planner-synthesized
 *   residual boolean nodes that share the dispatch allocator lifetime. Callers
 *   must not free or mutate residual trees.
 * - Verification results own their returned ordinal set unless a null residual
 *   allows exact pass-through, in which case the candidate set is returned
 *   unchanged as a borrowed exact result.
 * - Index descriptor lists are process-side configuration inputs. They retain
 *   descriptor pointers and are not copied into shards or marshal images.
 * - Per-shard result lists are the WP-008 internal handoff. Each result owns
 *   its verified ordinal set and copies only durable catalog metadata needed by
 *   execution: shard id, generation, schema generation, record count, seal
 *   timestamp, and partition route key. Results never expose resident handles,
 *   mapped shard handles, raw record pointers, raw mapped JSON pointers, public
 *   query cursors, or public query hits.
 *
 * The any-field marker is accepted only for catch-all search-compatible
 * predicates in this phase: @c N00B_PLAN_LEAF_CONTAINS. It is rejected for
 * range, exists, under/path, prefix, regex, equality, and IN leaves.
