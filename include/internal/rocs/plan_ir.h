/*
 * The two trees rocs queries are made of, and the accessors over them.
 *
 * A predicate tree says WHAT to match. A plan tree says HOW to get it. The
 * planner turns the first into the second; the interpreter runs the second.
 *
 *   predicate tree                        plan tree
 *   (what to match)                       (how to get it)
 *
 *   AND                                   INTERSECT
 *    |-- eq(kind,"build")     ------->     |-- INDEX_SCAN(term kind)
 *    '-- prefix(msg,"tim")                 '-- INTERSECT
 *                                              |-- INDEX_SCAN(ngram, lossy)
 *                                              '-- RECORD_SCAN(prefix)
 *
 * The predicate side is produced by filter.c lowering a public n00b_filter_t.
 * Its shapes are n00b_plan_predicate_t, n00b_plan_target_t, n00b_plan_path_t.
 *
 * The plan side is produced by n00b_plan_build (plan.h) and consumed by
 * n00b_plan_exec_* (eval.h). Its shape is n00b_plan_node_t. Every leaf names
 * the access it wants: INDEX_SCAN reads an index, RECORD_SCAN reads records.
 * A lossy index scan narrows without deciding, so the planner pairs it with
 * the RECORD_SCAN that settles it.
 *
 * Both sides answer in n00b_plan_ordset_t: a bitset of record positions within
 * a single shard, carrying that shard's 0..record_count-1 universe. Set
 * operations refuse to mix universes, and complement is relative to the
 * owning set's own record_count.
 *
 * Layouts live here because the planner writes them and the interpreter reads
 * them. Callers that only build and run queries need plan.h and eval.h.
