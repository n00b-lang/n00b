 * pointer in O(1): a range check against the main thread's kernel-stack
 * bounds (stored in its `n00b_thread_record_t` at init), then the
 * Phase-1 masking helper `n00b_callstack_id_word` for worker callstacks.

 * the requested tier to each OS's native scheduling primitive on the worker
 * itself (no pthread:
 *
 *   - macOS: Mach `thread_policy_set(THREAD_PRECEDENCE_POLICY)` with a signed
 *     `importance` (idle → -2 … realtime → +2).  Precedence is the queryable
 *     Mach surface (`thread_policy_get` reads it back); it is best-effort by
 *     construction and never fails the spawn.
 *   - Linux: raw `sched_setscheduler(SCHED_*)` + `setpriority(nice)` on the
 *     calling thread (NOT `pthread_setschedparam`):
 *       idle      → SCHED_IDLE,  nice +19
 *       low       → SCHED_OTHER, nice +10
 *       normal    → SCHED_OTHER, nice  0
 *       high      → SCHED_OTHER, nice -10
 *       realtime  → SCHED_FIFO,  rt-priority 10
 *   - Win32: `SetThreadPriority` (idle → THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE, low → BELOW,
 *     normal → NORMAL, high → ABOVE, realtime → TIME_CRITICAL).
 *
 * `.priority` and `.scheduler` are TWO NAMES for the SAME tier request (the
 * normalized model folds policy + priority into one ordered tier); passing
 * both is allowed and the launcher uses the higher of the two so a caller
 * cannot accidentally downgrade by setting one and leaving the other at the
 * default.  The exact per-OS mapping is NOT 1:1 and is documented above.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT: a privileged tier the process cannot grant (e.g.
 * `N00B_THREAD_TIER_REALTIME` without CAP_SYS_NICE on Linux) does NOT fail
 * the spawn — the worker runs at whatever the OS granted and the REQUESTED
 * tier is still recorded on `n00b_thread_t::sched_tier` for introspection.

 * are n00b-owned `int64_t`s (NOT a libc `struct sched_param` — no libc type
 * leaks into the public surface); each OS interprets them:
 *
 *   - Linux: `policy` is the `SCHED_*` constant for raw `sched_setscheduler`;
 *     `priority` is the rt-priority for the SCHED_FIFO/RR policies, or the
 *     `nice` value (via raw `setpriority`) for SCHED_OTHER/BATCH/IDLE.
 *   - macOS: `policy` selects the Mach policy flavor.
 *   - Win32: `policy` is unused; `priority` is the `SetThreadPriority` level.
 *
 * Like the tier path, the raw apply FAILS SOFT: an ungrantable request leaves
 * the worker at the OS default and the spawn still succeeds.  The descriptor
 * itself need only live for the duration of the spawn call (it is copied onto
 * the bundle); the applied values are recorded on
 * `n00b_thread_t::sched_raw` for introspection.

/**
 * @brief CPU-id set for thread affinity
 *
 * A caller asks for a worker's CPU affinity via
 * `n00b_thread_spawn(.affinity = &(n00b_thread_cpuset_t){.mask = …})`.  The set
 * is a FIXED 64-bit bitmask: bit `n` set means "CPU `n` is in the set" (so this
 * representation addresses logical CPUs 0..63; see the >64-CPU note below).
 * The launcher applies the set to the worker ITSELF (no pthread),
 * with per-OS strength:
 *
 *   - Linux: HARD PIN via raw `sched_setaffinity(0, sizeof(unsigned long),
 *     &mask)` (tid 0 = self) — NOT `pthread_setaffinity_np`, and WITHOUT
 *     glibc's `cpu_set_t`/`CPU_SET` macros: the @ref mask word IS the raw
 *     kernel cpu-set (one `unsigned long` on LP64, low bit = CPU 0), so it is
 *     handed to the syscall directly with `cpusetsize = sizeof(unsigned long)`.
 *   - Win32: HARD PIN via `SetThreadAffinityMask(GetCurrentThread(), mask)` —
 *     the `DWORD_PTR` mask is the @ref mask word truncated to pointer width.
 *   - macOS: ADVISORY ONLY.  Darwin exposes no hard CPU pin to user space; the
 *     launcher applies Mach `thread_policy_set(THREAD_AFFINITY_POLICY)` with an
 *     `affinity_tag` DERIVED from the set (the 1-based index of the lowest set
 *     CPU, so workers requesting the same lowest CPU share an L2-affinity tag).
 *     This is a SCHEDULER HINT, not a pin — the kernel may run the worker on
 *     any CPU (THREAD_AFFINITY_POLICY is documented "experimental" and a hint).
 *     Tests MUST NOT assert a hard pin on macOS.
 *
 * An EMPTY set (`mask == 0`) requests no affinity and is treated as "leave the
 * OS default" on every platform (no syscall is made).  Like the scheduling
 * attributes, the apply is best-effort: a failed `sched_setaffinity` /
 * `SetThreadAffinityMask` (e.g. a mask naming no online CPU) is IGNORED and the
 * worker keeps running; the REQUESTED set is still recorded on
 * @ref n00b_thread_t::affinity for introspection.
 *
 * >64-CPU NOTE: the fixed 64-bit mask addresses logical CPUs 0..63.  Machines
 * with more than 64 CPUs are not addressable above CPU 63 through this type; a
 * growable cpu-set is a possible future widening (the raw Linux syscall already
 * takes a `cpusetsize`, so the kernel side scales) but is NOT implemented

/**
 * @brief Get a pointer to the calling thread's runtime-owned n00b_thread_t.
 *
 * Evaluates to the calling thread's `n00b_thread_t *`, or nullptr when
 * called before the runtime / main thread is registered.  O(1),
 * lock-free, TLS-free.
 *
 * This is a function-like **macro** (statement expression), not a
 * function, by design: ncc emits a GC stack-map push in every
 * framed function's prologue, and that push calls `n00b_thread_self()`.
 * A framed `n00b_thread_self()` would therefore recurse through its own prologue.
 * As a macro it has no prologue to instrument, and its entire body is
 * instrumentation-free — it expands to pure atomic loads (compiler
 * intrinsics via the `n00b_atomic_load` macro), `__builtin_frame_address`
 * for the SP, and masking arithmetic, calling no framed function.  In
 * particular it reaches the runtime through the `n00b_default_runtime`
 * global with the `n00b_option_*` macros rather than any accessor.
 *
 * Call sites are unchanged: `n00b_thread_self()` reads identically and
 * `&n00b_thread_self()->field` remains a valid address-of-a-field.
 *
 * Recovery, instrumentation-free on every branch:
 *   - Startup window (no runtime / no thread table): the bootstrap struct.
 *   - Main thread: an O(1) range check of the SP against the kernel-stack
 *     bounds published in N00B_MAIN_THREAD_SLOT's record at init.
 *   - Worker / non-main / FOREIGN: a foreign-safe bounds scan.  Every
 *     registered thread (n00b worker, main, or an attached foreign thread)
 *     publishes its real `stack_lo`/`stack_hi` into its slot record at init
 *     and sets its bit in `rt->live_slot_bits`.  This branch walks the live
 *     bits and returns the thread whose `[stack_lo, stack_hi)` brackets the
 *     SP.  It reads ONLY runtime memory (`rt->live_slot_bits`, `rt->threads[]`)
 *     — never the caller's own stack region — so it cannot fault, and it
 *     resolves a not-yet-attached foreign thread to nullptr (it brackets no
 *     live slot), which the GC-stack-push pre-registration window tolerates.
 *     `live_slot_bits` is set AFTER bounds are published and cleared BEFORE
 *     they are torn down, so a set bit always pairs with valid bounds; that
 *     gates the walk to live threads (O(live), not O(max_threads)).  Inline,
 *     lock-free — atomic loads + ctz + masking, no framed call.
 *
 *     This replaced the earlier O(1) masked id-word read at `base + S - 8`
 *     which FAULTED for foreign (non-callstack) threads whose
 *     masked region top is unmapped — e.g. the Crayon gateway's libdispatch
 *     reply threads (fill_es_subscription_bits / enqueue_payload), which are
 *     foreign to n00b yet reach n00b_thread_self() via the gc-stack-push
 *     prologue.  The bounds scan never dereferences the caller's region top,
 *     so it is sound for any thread.
 *
 * @note Each translation unit that uses this macro must have the full
 *       `n00b_runtime_t` definition (`core/runtime.h`) in scope, since
 *       the body dereferences `rt->threads[]` / `rt->max_threads`.  thread.h
 *       does NOT include core/runtime.h: runtime.h pulls in thread.h
 *       (n00b_thread_record_t is embedded by value in n00b_runtime_t's
 *       thread table), so including it here is a hard circular dependency.
 *       Callers therefore include core/runtime.h themselves (every current
 *       n00b_thread_self() caller already does, via the N00b internal-API umbrella).

 *
 * Reserves a thread slot, allocates an n00b callstack, and creates a raw
 * OS thread (no pthread) wrapped in the n00b launcher (GC registration,
 * STW participation, lock cleanup on exit).
 *
 * Threads are detached from the spawner by default. A spawned worker
 * needs NO join to avoid a leak.  Its OS resources (the 8 MiB
 * callstack and the minimal TCB) are reclaimed by the runtime reaper
 * at OS-CONFIRMED death (the worker enqueues itself as it exits; the
 * reaper returns the callstack to the callstack pool and frees the
 * TCB only once the OS confirms it is off that stack — macOS dead
 * Mach port / Linux CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID), and the returned
 * n00b_thread_t struct is GC-owned (it lives in the runtime's
 * GC-visible, non-moving user_pool) and is collected once it becomes
 * unreferenced.  "Detached" is therefore the implicit model — there
 * is no `.detached`/`.attached` attribute: a thread is reaped
 * and collected regardless of whether anyone joins it.  "Joinable"
 * simply means the caller KEPT the returned handle: while that handle
 * is held in a GC-scanned location it keeps the struct alive, the
 * caller may n00b_thread_join() it for the result (see below), and
 * the caller may safely read the handle's fields after the worker has
 * died.  Dropping the last reference to a dead worker's handle lets
 * the GC collect the struct.
 *
 * The positional `(fn, arg)` call shape is the common case and stays
 * source-compatible.  Optional spawn attributes are supplied as keyword
 * arguments:
 *
 * @param fn   Thread entry point.
 * @param arg  Argument passed to @p fn.
 *
 * @kw name           OS thread name applied to the worker (per-OS raw
 *                    primitive) and stored on the worker's
 *                    n00b_thread_t::name.  nullptr (default) leaves the
 *                    worker unnamed.  Linux applies it via raw
 *                    prctl(PR_SET_NAME); Win32 via SetThreadDescription;
 *                    macOS stores it on the struct only (the off-libpthread
 *                    raw proc_info SETCONTROL path is a surfaced deferral —
 *                    its kernel-internal call number is unverifiable from any
 *                    SDK header, so it is not guessed on the worker path).
 * @kw finalizer      Cleanup callback run EXACTLY ONCE on the worker as it
 *                    exits, BEFORE the join handshake wakes the joiner
 *                    (so a joiner never observes "done" before cleanup).
 *                    nullptr (default) means no finalizer.  This is NOT a GC
 *                    struct finalizer: the n00b_thread_t is GC-owned, so the
 *                    finalizer runs in the launcher exit path on the worker,
 *                    not via the GC.
 * @kw finalizer_data Opaque argument passed to @p finalizer (default nullptr).
 * @kw custom_stack   Pointer to a caller-owned backing region (base + size)
 *                    for the worker's callstack.  When non-null, n00b
 *                    lays its `S`-aligned power-of-2 + ID-word geometry over
 *                    the caller's pages instead of allocating a fresh
 *                    callstack, so the worker still resolves `n00b_thread_self()` in O(1)
 *                    (`n00b_callstack_alloc_over`).  The region MUST be at
 *                    least `2 * N00B_CALLSTACK_REGION_SIZE` bytes (so an
 *                    `S`-aligned sub-region can be carved); an undersized /
 *                    un-alignable region fails the spawn with
 *                    `N00B_ERR_CALLSTACK_REGION_UNUSABLE`.  OWNERSHIP STAYS
 *                    WITH THE CALLER: n00b never frees or unmaps the region
 *                    (the reaper, which reclaims the callstack at OS-confirmed
 *                    death, only drops the mmap-tree registration for a
 *                    caller-owned region so the GC tree stays balanced — it
 *                    does not unmap the caller's pages); the caller must keep
 *                    the region alive until the worker has finished and free
 *                    it itself afterward.  The descriptor itself need only
 *                    live for the duration of the spawn call (it is copied).
 *                    The default (nullptr) allocates an n00b callstack as
 *                    usual.  This is also the mechanism that closes the Win32
 *                    `n00b_thread_self()` gap: a Win32 worker run on the carved
 *                    n00b region resolves identity.  NOTE: `n00b_thread_spawn`
 *                    takes no `.allocator` kwarg, so the small `n00b_callstack_t`
 *                    bookkeeping struct is taken from the default allocator
 *                    regardless of the caller's arena context (the backing
 *                    pages themselves are the caller's own).
 * @kw priority       Requested scheduling tier (@ref n00b_thread_tier_t,
 *                    default N00B_THREAD_TIER_DEFAULT = leave OS default).
 *                    Applied to the worker on the worker itself via the per-OS
 *                    raw primitive (macOS Mach thread_policy_set; Linux raw
 *                    sched_setscheduler/setpriority; Win32 SetThreadPriority).
 *                    `.priority` and `.scheduler` are two names for the SAME
 *                    tier request (the normalized model folds policy+priority
 *                    into one ordered tier); when both are set the launcher
 *                    uses the higher.  An ungrantable privileged tier (e.g.
 *                    realtime without privilege) FAILS SOFT — the spawn still
 *                    succeeds and the requested tier is recorded on
 *                    n00b_thread_t::sched_tier.  See @ref n00b_thread_tier_t
 *                    for the full per-OS mapping table.
 * @kw scheduler      Alias for @kw priority (same tier request; see above).
 * @kw sched_raw      Optional pointer to a raw per-OS scheduling descriptor
 *                    (@ref n00b_thread_sched_raw_t).  When non-null it BYPASSES
 *                    the tier mapping and the launcher applies its {policy,
 *                    priority} directly to the OS primitive on the worker.
 *                    Also fails soft.  The descriptor is copied; it need only
 *                    live for the duration of the spawn call.  Default nullptr
 *                    (use the tier path).
 * @kw affinity       Optional pointer to a CPU-id set (@ref n00b_thread_cpuset_t)
 *                    applied to the worker on the worker itself.  HARD-PINS the
 *                    worker on Linux (raw sched_setaffinity) and Win32
 *                    (SetThreadAffinityMask); on macOS the apply is ADVISORY
 *                    ONLY (Mach thread_policy_set THREAD_AFFINITY_POLICY — a
 *                    scheduler hint, not a pin; tests must not assert a pin
 *                    there).  Fails soft: an un-honorable set leaves the worker
 *                    unpinned and the spawn still succeeds, with the REQUESTED
 *                    set recorded on n00b_thread_t::affinity.  An empty set
 *                    (mask == 0) or nullptr (default) requests no affinity.  The
 *                    descriptor is copied; it need only live for the duration of
 *                    the spawn call.  NUMA co-location is DEFERRED and expressed
 *                    meanwhile via this set — see @ref n00b_thread_cpuset_t.
 * @kw isolation      When true (default false), the worker runs ISOLATED from
 *                    the GC's conservative stack scan: the collector does NOT
 *                    treat the worker's raw C stack as a root source (it is
 *                    excluded from the conservative range scan in
 *                    n00b_scan_thread_stacks; the flag is recorded on
 *                    n00b_thread_t::gc_isolated and applied on the worker by
 *                    the launcher).  The worker's thread struct, its
 *                    n00b_thread_record_t, and its lock chains are STILL
 *                    scanned — isolation never corrupts the GC's view of the
 *                    worker's locks; only the worker's own C-stack words are
 *                    no longer scanned conservatively.
 *
 *                    SELF-REGISTRATION CONTRACT (caller responsibility): an
 *                    isolated worker MUST itself keep alive any GC-heap object
 *                    it holds, because the collector will no longer find that
 *                    object by scanning the worker's C stack.  It does so by
 *                    EITHER (a) being compiled with exact GC stack maps so its
 *                    live roots are published via the compiler's GC stack-frame
 *                    push (gc_stack_policy != N00B_GC_STACK_CONSERVATIVE — note
 *                    an exact-scanned worker is already not conservatively
 *                    scanned, so `.isolation` matters specifically for a
 *                    conservatively-scanned worker that wants OUT), OR (b)
 *                    registering the memory as a persistent GC root via
 *                    n00b_gc_register_root() / _n00b_gc_register_root() (see
 *                    include/core/gc.h), OR (c) keeping every such object also
 *                    reachable from an already-scanned root (the thread struct,
 *                    a registered global, or a non-isolated thread's stack).
 *                    A heap object that is reachable ONLY from an isolated
 *                    worker's C stack and is none of the above WILL be
 *                    collected as garbage → use-after-free.
 *
 * @kw crash_handler  Optional per-thread crash callback
 *                    (@ref n00b_thread_crash_handler_t, default nullptr = none)

 * reaper reclaims the callstack/TCB at OS-CONFIRMED death (the worker is still
 * on its stack at the moment a joiner observes "done", so reclamation cannot
 * happen here), and the GC reclaims the struct once it becomes unreferenced
 * (the struct lives in the GC-visible user_pool).  Joining is therefore purely
 * a synchronization-plus-result operation; a worker that is never joined is
 * still reaped and collected (the default-detached model — see
 * @ref n00b_thread_spawn).
 *
 * The `void *` return is the worker's fn() return value and is INDEPENDENT
 * of the 64-bit exit code: a worker can both return a `void *`
 * and stash a separate exit code via n00b_thread_exit().  Read the exit
 * code with n00b_thread_exit_code() after this call returns; it remains
