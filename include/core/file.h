/**
 * @file file.h
 * @brief Unified file API over conduit-stream + mmap substrates.
 *
 * One read/write/seek surface for both event-driven streaming I/O
 * (conduit `fd_owner` underneath) and random-access mmap'd buffers
 * (`core/file_map.h` underneath). Callers pick the substrate at open
 * time; everything afterwards is uniform.
 *
 *  - `N00B_FILE_KIND_STREAM`: forward-only, suited to hashes, scans,
 *    and any sequential consumer. Memory profile bounded by the
 *    conduit accumulator's chunk size, regardless of file size.
 *  - `N00B_FILE_KIND_MMAP`: full random access, zero-copy slicing
 *    via `n00b_file_as_buffer()`. Resident set ≈ pages actually
 *    touched (kernel demand-pages).
 *  - `N00B_FILE_KIND_AUTO`: regular files → MMAP (read-only) or
 *    STREAM (writable); pipes/sockets/devices → STREAM.
 *
 * Read semantics: `n00b_file_read(f, max_n)` returns up to `max_n`
 * bytes, possibly fewer (short read or near-EOF). Returns a zero-byte
 * buffer at EOF; subsequent calls remain at EOF.
 *
 * Seek semantics: STREAM supports forward-only seeks (negative or
 * absolute-into-past returns `EINVAL`); MMAP supports full seeking
 * including SEEK_END. The substrate kind is queryable via
 * `n00b_file_get_kind` for callers that need to know.
 *
 * Async-read semantics: STREAM forwards to `n00b_conduit_read_async`
 * on the FD's read_topic. MMAP performs the read synchronously and
 * pushes the result to the caller's inbox before returning (the
 * "async contract" is the inbox delivery, not deferred work).
