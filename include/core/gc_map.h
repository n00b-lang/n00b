/**
 * @file gc_map.h
 * @brief Per-allocation GC scan-bitmap API.
 *
 * The GC's conservative scanner treats every 8-byte-aligned word of an
 * allocation as a candidate heap pointer.  That is wrong for backing
 * stores that mix pointers and scalars (e.g. a `uint32_t[]` whose
 * adjacent pairs happen to form a pointer-shaped 8-byte value): the
 * collector forwards the bogus "pointer" and rewrites the slot,
 * corrupting unrelated scalar data.
 *
 * This header restores a per-allocation precision mechanism.  An
 * allocation declares its scan shape (`n00b_gc_scan_kind_t`); the
 * `CALLBACK` shape invokes a user-supplied function that fills an
 * `n00b_gc_map_t` bitmap — one bit per word — to tell the collector
 * which words are pointers.  The collector forwards only those words.
 *
 * Step 1 of `~/dd/gc-bits.md` introduces just the bitmap data type,
 * its helpers, and a small set of built-in callbacks.  GC integration
 * is wired up in later steps.

 * patterns that the collector can apply without an indirect call.
