// NOTE: like core/mutex.h, this header deliberately does NOT include
// core/futex.h.  futex.h carries inline functions that dereference the runtime
// struct, and core/runtime.h now embeds an n00b_rwlock_t by value (the
// critical_execution STW lock) — pulling futex.h in here would parse those
// inlines before n00b_runtime_t is complete (an include cycle).  `n00b_futex_t`
// is the typedef from n00b.h; code that calls the futex API (e.g. rwlock.c)
// includes core/futex.h directly.
