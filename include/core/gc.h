/**

 * @brief Garbage collector interface and supporting types.
 *
 * Implements a copying/compacting collector for @c n00b_arena_t heaps.
 * When an arena runs out of space and has @c collection_enabled set,
 * @c n00b_collect() copies live allocations to a new arena segment,
 * rewrites all pointers, and releases the old memory.
 *
 * The collector traces:
 *   - User-registered GC roots (@ref n00b_gc_register_root)
 *   - Thread stacks (all registered threads)
 *   - The @c argv / @c envp arrays in @c n00b_runtime_t
 *
 * @c n00b_collect() owns the stop-the-world lock internally.
