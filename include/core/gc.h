/**
 * @file gc.h
 * @brief Garbage collector interface and supporting types.
 *
 * Implements a copying/compacting collector for @c n00b_arena_t heaps.
 * When an arena runs out of space and has @c collection_enabled set,
 * @c n00b_collect() copies live allocations to a new arena segment,
 * rewrites all pointers, and releases the old memory.
 *
 * The collector traces:
 *   - User-registered GC roots (@ref n00b_gc_register_root)
 *   - Thread stacks (all registered threads)
 *   - The @c argv / @c envp arrays in @c n00b_runtime_t
 *
 * Callers must hold the stop-the-world lock before invoking
 * @c n00b_collect().

 * Init-time-only with respect to concurrent collection: callers
 * must invoke during process init or before any `n00b_collect()`
 * runs. Not thread-safe with concurrent collection.
 *
 * **Pre-`n00b_init` defer behavior (WP-003 / D-036, F-4):** ncc's
 * `--ncc-auto-gc-roots` transform emits a `[[gnu::constructor]]`
 * in every libn00b TU that owns this very function. Those
 * constructors fire during dynamic loader init, before
 * `n00b_init()` builds the runtime that owns `gc_roots`. If this
 * function is called before the runtime exists, the entries are
 * parked in a TU-local defer queue inside `src/core/gc.c`.
 * `n00b_init()` flushes the queue (calling
 * `_n00b_gc_flush_deferred_roots()` internally) once
 * `runtime->gc_roots` is allocated, replaying every parked entry
 * through the runtime-resident dedup path in registration order.
 *
 * The defer queue uses libc `calloc`/`free` for its chunk
 * storage because the n00b allocator does not exist yet during
 * dynamic loader ctor phase. The queue is single-threaded by
 * construction (loader ctors are sequenced before `main()`); no
 * lock is taken on either the write path or the flush path.
 *
 * Callers from runtime-resident code (anything sequenced after
 * `n00b_init`) bypass the defer queue entirely and go through the
 * single-entry dedup path immediately.
 *
 * @param roots Pointer to an array of n00b_gc_root_t entries.
 *              The array must outlive the process (typically a
 *              `static` table emitted by ncc's `--ncc-auto-gc-roots`
 *              transform).
 * @param count Number of entries in @p roots. Zero is a clean
 *              no-op; @p roots may be `nullptr` when @p count is
 *              zero.
