/**
 * @file n00b_attest_mark.h
 * @brief n00b_attest ↔ libchalk bridge — the in-binary attestation
 *        mark surface (WP-005 Phase 1).
 *
 * Public library API for the three "Cut M" entry points:
 * `n00b_attest_mark_artifact`, `n00b_attest_unmark`, and
 * `n00b_attest_extract_from_artifact`. These compose libchalk's
 * mark / extract / delete dispatch with n00b_attest's DSSE
 * envelope substrate to produce + read chalk marks whose
 * `ATTESTATION` field carries the canonical JSON shape documented
 * in `docs/attest/04-in-container-identity.md` §1.
 *
 * # IC-4 enablement
 *
 * `mark_artifact` returns the unchalked SHA-256 (32 raw bytes,
 * NOT `sha256:<hex>` form) as part of the
 * @ref n00b_attest_mark_result_t row type. Callers cross-check
 * the value against the envelope's
 * `subject.digest.sha256` (the WP-003 verifier handles that on
 * the verify path). The byte form is chosen so the cross-check
 * is byte-comparison; CLI shims that need a hex display format
 * locally.
 *
 * # IC-5 sentinel discrimination
 *
 * `extract_from_artifact` distinguishes the four IC-5 cases via
 * four Err-code legs:
 *
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_NO_MARK — case (i): artifact
 *     carries no chalk mark.
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_NO_ATTESTATION — case (ii):
 *     mark present but `ATTESTATION` field absent.
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_MALFORMED_ATTESTATION — case
 *     (iii): `ATTESTATION` field present but content does not
 *     match the canonical JSON shape.
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_CODEC_LOOKUP_FAILED — case
 *     (iv): bytes do not match any libchalk codec
 *     (`n00b_chalk_detect_file` returned `N00B_CHALK_CODEC_NONE`).
 *
 * The Err-code shape is chosen over a discriminated Ok-payload
 * enum because all four cases carry no useful Ok value and the
 * `n00b_result_t(T) → Err(err_t)` convention is the established
 * n00b_attest precedent.
 *
 * # ATTESTATION JSON shape
 *
 * Per `docs/attest/04-in-container-identity.md` §1, the
 * canonical shape is:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "envelope_digest":   "sha256:...",
 *   "predicate_types":   ["https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1", ...],
 *   "registry_hint":     "ghcr.io/myorg/myrepo:tag",
 *   "signer_keyid":      "ab12cd34...",
 *
 *   // Present in bundled mode (default), absent in lazy mode:
 *   "envelopes": [
 *     {
 *       "predicate_type":  "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1",
 *       "envelope_base64": "<DSSE bytes>"
 *     },
 *     ...
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `envelope_digest` is the SHA-256 of envelope[0]'s wire bytes
 * when multiple envelopes are bundled (the field is singular per
 * the spec); the per-envelope digests are derivable from
 * `envelopes[]` in bundled mode. Field order is fixed via
 * ordered string concatenation (D-056 — `n00b_dict_t` iteration
 * order is not guaranteed and would break byte-stability).
 *
 * # Allocator discipline
 *
 * Every allocating entry point carries `.allocator = nullptr`
 * per FR-21 / D-060 — `nullptr` selects the runtime default;
 * any non-null allocator is threaded forward through every
 * downstream allocation (including the libchalk dispatch's
 * scratch buffers via the `alloc_for_call` idiom; D-045).
 *
 * # Scope of Phase 1
 *
 * Phase 1 ships the n00b-attest-side library + tests only.
 * Out-of-scope and landed in later phases:
 *
 *   - CLI verb shims (`mark`, `unmark`, `extract`): Phase 2.
 *   - libchalk re-sign helpers (PE Authenticode, Mach-O
 *     codesign): Phases 3-5.
 *   - `signer_identity` kwarg on `_mark_artifact`: Phase 6.
 *   - `harvest` verb + `_harvest_attestations`: deferred to a
 *     future WP-015 ("Cut H") per the no-deferrals constraint;
 *     not surfaced here as a deferral because the user
 *     pre-dispositioned the carve-out at WP-005 kickoff.

 *                       must have a payload attached (the

 *                    BEFORE the artifact's bytes are touched.
 *                    `nullptr` (default) omits the field from
 *                    the JSON (the verifier falls back to
 *                    discovery via subject digest).
 * @kw allocator       Optional allocator (defaults to the runtime
 *                     allocator). Threaded through every internal
 *                     allocation (libchalk dispatch, JSON build,
 *                     base64 encode); the returned row type and
 *                     its embedded buffer / string fields all live
 *                     in this allocator.
 * @kw signer_identity Optional resolved signer identity. When
 *                     non-null AND the codec is PE or Mach-O, the
 *                     mark insertion is followed by a re-sign
 *                     dispatch (`n00b_chalk_pe_resign` /
 *                     `n00b_chalk_macho_resign`) that hashes the
 *                     post-mark bytes, builds an Authenticode /
 *                     Mach-O signature with the supplied identity,
 *                     and writes the signed binary back. For ELF
 *                     and all other codecs the kwarg is ignored
 *                     (the re-sign step is skipped regardless of
 *                     its value). `nullptr` (default) selects no
 *                     re-sign: the mark is inserted but no
 *                     platform signature is added.
 *
 *                     Identity URIs are resolved by the caller via
 *                     `n00b_chalk_signer_identity_resolve` —
 *                     supported URI shapes are
 *                     `file://cert.pem,file://key.pem` (paired PEM
 *                     files) and `store://<name>` (XDG store).
 *                     `n00b_chalk_signer_identity_release` must be
 *                     called by the caller on success or failure.
 *
 * @return `n00b_result_ok(n00b_attest_mark_result_t *, row)` on
 *         success — the row carries the pre-insert unchalked
 *         SHA-256 (32 raw bytes), the libchalk output kind, and
 *         the sidecar suffix (when applicable). Err legs route
 *         through:
 *
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_BAD_REGISTRY_HINT — the
 *           `registry_hint` kwarg failed
 *           `n00b_attest_oci_url_parse`.
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_BAD_ENVELOPE — one of the
 *           supplied envelopes is malformed
 *           (`_get_payload` failed or the embedded Statement
 *           lacks a predicateType).
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_INSERT_FAILED — libchalk's
 *           @c n00b_chalk_insert_file returned an Err leg
 *           (codec mismatch, file-read failure, codec-internal
 *           failure, file-write failure; the libchalk Err code
 *           shape is not currently differentiated at this layer).

 *           step failed. Callers that need atomicity of mark + sign

 *           field but its content does not match the canonical
 *           JSON shape (missing required fields, wrong field
 *           types, malformed embedded envelope base64, etc.).
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_CHALK_EXTRACT_FAILED — libchalk

 *           internal failure).
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_DSSE_BAD_INPUT — `artifact_path`

 *
 * @post On Ok, the row's embedded buffers / strings live in the
 *       per-call allocator. The artifact's bytes are NOT
 *       modified by this entry point.
