/**
 * @file n00b_attest_oci.h
 * @brief OCI integration public surface — client handle, auth handle,
 *        and lifecycle entry points.
 *
 * Declarations for the opaque `n00b_attest_oci_client_t` and
 * `n00b_attest_oci_auth_t` types and the resolver / construction /
 * release entry points. The OCI client is the narrow HTTPS request /
 * response edge tailored to OCI 1.1 distribution-spec registries:
 * the substrate Phase 2's push and Phase 3's pull / discover verbs
 * compose on top of (D-051 OQ-2 + D-044 library-API-first split).
 *
 * # Algorithm-agnostic by construction (D-016)
 *
 * The OCI client is algorithm-agnostic by design: it ferries opaque
 * bytes (manifests, blobs, descriptors) to and from a registry. The
 * public surface bakes in no Ed25519-specific symbols and no other
 * algorithm tags. The signer / verifier abstractions handle algorithm
 * dispatch one layer up; the OCI client carries the resulting bytes.
 *
 * # Auth-source dispatch (D-051 OQ-1)
 *
 * WP-004 Phase 1 ships three of the five planned auth sources:
 *
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_OCI_AUTH_CALLER — caller passes a pre-built
 *     auth handle to @ref n00b_attest_oci_client_new.
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_OCI_AUTH_REGISTRIES_JSON — reads
 *     `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/n00b-attest/registries.json` (or
 *     `~/.config/n00b-attest/registries.json` when the env var is
 *     unset). NOT a drop-in `~/.docker/config.json` reader; the
 *     schema is N00B-specific.
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_OCI_AUTH_ANONYMOUS — no token; the request
 *     helper omits the `Authorization` header.
 *
 * The remaining two sources are declared NOW in @ref
 * n00b_attest_oci_auth_source_t for forward-compat:
 *
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_OCI_AUTH_CRED_HELPER — docker-credential-
 *     helper subprocess; requires `n00b_subproc_*` substrate that
 *     does not exist yet. Future Tier-2 WP.
 *   - @ref N00B_ATTEST_OCI_AUTH_KEYCHAIN — macOS Keychain via
 *     `Security.framework`; requires Objective-C bridging +
 *     entitlement disposition. Future Tier-2 WP.
 *
 * Invoking @ref n00b_attest_oci_auth_resolve with one of the
 * not-yet-shipped sources returns @ref
 * N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_AUTH_SOURCE_NOT_FOUND.
 *
 * # Token-exchange (OCI distribution-spec § 5)
 *
 * On a 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=...,service=...,
 * scope=...`, the request helper performs a second un-authenticated
 * GET against the realm URL (passing `service` + `scope` query
 * params), parses the `{"token": "..."}` (or `{"access_token":
 * "..."}`) response, caches the token on the client handle, and
 * retries the original request with the new bearer. A second 401
 * surfaces @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_BEARER_TOKEN_FAILED. The
 * token-exchange flow lives behind the internal `_request` helper
 * in `include/internal/attest/oci/registry.h` (not visible to
 * library consumers).
 *
 * # Lifetime
 *
 * Client and auth handles are reusable for the duration of a
 * publish / fetch session: build once, request many, release once.
 * The library maintains NO process-wide cache. Both `_release`
 * entry points are no-ops on null and tolerate double-release
 * silently (matches the libn00b release-then-use convention).
 *
 * @ref n00b_attest_oci_auth_release does NOT `crypto_wipe` the
 * held bearer / basic credentials in WP-004 Phase 1: bearer tokens
 * are short-lived (registry-issued, scope-bounded), and the
 * `crypto_wipe` discipline applies to long-lived secret-key material
 * (signer release). Defensive wipe of bearer-token state is a
 * Phase 4 hardening concern.
 *
 * # Allocator discipline
 *
 * Every allocating entry point on this surface carries
 * `.allocator = nullptr`. Threading an arena through
 * @ref n00b_attest_oci_client_new makes every byte the client
 * produces while serving subsequent requests live in that arena
 * (FR-21 / FR-22).
 *
 * # Optional-pointer kwargs (D-035 part 2 / DF-009)
 *
 * Optional pointer kwargs on this surface use `T * = nullptr`
 * rather than `n00b_option_t(T) = n00b_option_none(T)`, matching
 * the existing WP-001 / WP-002 / WP-003 module surfaces. This is a
 * project-local exception to the cross-project canonical
 * `n00b_option_t` shape; cross-project normalization is a later
 * cleanup WP.
 *
 * # No public symbols beyond this header
 *
 * The OCI substrate ships exactly: two opaque types + one auth-
 * source enum + four lifecycle entry points (`_client_new`,
 * `_auth_resolve`, `_client_release`, `_auth_release`). Internal
 * helpers (`_request`, `_url_parse`) live in
 * `include/internal/attest/oci/registry.h` for Phase 2+ consumers.

 *                the first non-empty credential found in any source.

 * @kw sources    Optional ordered list of @ref

 *                indicating which sources to walk and in what

 *                default order: @c [CALLER, REGISTRIES_JSON,
 *                ANONYMOUS]. Default `nullptr`.
 * @kw allocator  Optional allocator (defaults to the runtime
 *                allocator). Owns the returned auth handle plus
 *                every byte the resolver allocates while walking

 *         (per-source diagnostic detail) are deferred to the
 *         libn00b typed-Err-payload lift tracked as DF-011.
 *
 * @note Per @ref N00B_ATTEST_OCI_AUTH_CALLER's documentation, the

 *       source chain so that "caller-provided" remains a documented
 *       step in the resolution order; the resolver itself
 *       constructs nothing for it.
 *
 * @post The returned auth handle owns a copy of the credential
 *       bytes (bearer token, or base64-of-user:pass for Basic).
 *       The caller MUST call @ref n00b_attest_oci_auth_release at

 *
 *   1. Compute the envelope's SHA-256 digest.
 *   2. HEAD the subject image manifest to learn its byte-size
 *      (HEAD-primary + GET-fallback per D-054; some non-strict

 *   4. Build the canonical OCI 1.1 artifact-manifest JSON
 *      referring to the subject image manifest and the envelope
 *      layer, carrying the predicate-type and signer-keyid
 *      annotations.
 *   5. Compute the manifest's own SHA-256 digest.
 *   6. PUT-upload the manifest at
 *      `/v2/<name>/manifests/<manifest-digest>`. The registry
 *      treats the upload as a referrer of the subject by virtue
 *      of the `subject` field inside the manifest.
 *   7. Return the manifest digest.
 *

 *                     (HEAD subject + POST/PUT blob + PUT

 *                     defaults because push has the most sub-

 *           the registry-reported manifest digest disagreed with
 *           the locally-computed digest (integrity concern;

 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_DSSE_BAD_INPUT — a required
 *           kwarg was null at call time.
 *
 *         Phase 2 ships bare-code Err legs per D-053; richer Err
 *         payloads (HTTP status, registry response body, human-
 *         readable diagnostic text) are deferred to the libn00b
 *         typed-Err-payload future lift tracked as DF-011.
 *
 * @note No module-level state — the function is safe to invoke
 *       concurrently from multiple threads against DIFFERENT
 *       client handles. The single client handle itself is
 *       single-owner; concurrent calls against the same client
 *       are not safe (matches the libn00b convention).
 *
 * @pre The OCI client + auth handles in @p client were
 *      constructed against the same registry origin to which the
 *      caller intends to push. The subject image manifest
 *      identified by @p image_digest must already be present in
 *      that registry — Step 2 above HEADs the subject pre-push
 *      and surfaces 404 as @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_HTTP_ERROR.
 * @post The envelope blob, the artifact manifest, and the
 *       referrer link from the artifact manifest's `subject`
 *       field to the subject image manifest are durably stored
 *       in the registry. The client's cached bearer token (if
 *       any) may have rotated.

 *
 * **Does NOT verify the envelope.** Verification is a separate
 * @ref n00b_attest_cli_verify invocation. Pull's job is exactly the
 * round-trip "get me the bytes back"; signature verification is a
 * deliberately-distinct verb so the consumer can audit the bytes
 * in-place before trusting them.
 *
 * The function assumes the referrer manifest follows the spec §8.2
 * shape that the push side produces: single `layers[]` entry whose
 * `mediaType` is `application/vnd.in-toto+json` and whose `digest`
 * points at the envelope blob. A `layers[]` count other than 1, or
 * a missing `digest` field, surfaces as
 * @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_BAD_REFERRER_INDEX.
 *
 * @param client            OCI client handle. Required.
 * @param name              Repository name. Required.
 * @param manifest_digest   Referrer manifest digest (`sha256:<hex>`).
 *                          Required.
 *
 * @kw timeout_ms  Optional per-call wall-clock deadline in
 *                 milliseconds applied to EACH of the two
 *                 round-trips this verb composes (manifest fetch
 *                 + blob fetch). `0` falls through to the client-
 *                 level `timeout_ms` set at @ref
 *                 n00b_attest_oci_client_new; if that is also
 *                 `0`, the pull-specific default of 30000 ms
 *                 applies per D-051 OQ-8. Default `0`.
 * @kw allocator  Optional allocator (defaults to the client's
 *                construction-time allocator). Owns the returned
 *                envelope buffer.
 *
 * @return `n00b_result_ok(n00b_buffer_t *, envelope_bytes)` on
 *         success. Err legs route through:
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_BAD_URL — null inputs.
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_HTTP_ERROR — transport / non-
 *           success status on the manifest fetch or blob fetch.
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_BLOB_DIGEST_MISMATCH — fetched
 *           blob's SHA-256 disagrees with the manifest's claimed
 *           `layers[0].digest`.
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_BLOB_TOO_LARGE — fetched blob
 *           exceeds the size cap (1 MiB by default per NFR-5).
 *         - @ref N00B_ATTEST_ERR_OCI_BAD_REFERRER_INDEX — manifest
 *           JSON shape did not match spec §8.2 single-layer
 *           in-toto+json expectation.
 *
 * @post The returned envelope buffer is owned by the per-call
 *       allocator. The caller can pass it directly into
 *       @ref n00b_attest_cli_verify for verification, or into
 *       @ref n00b_attest_envelope_parse for inspection.
