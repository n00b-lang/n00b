/**
 * @file rocs/query.h
 * @brief Public query-view declarations for rocs snapshot and live reads.
 *
 * Query views are process-side handles over a committed store boundary.
 * Snapshot cursors expose borrowed hit handles in deterministic durable
 * position order. Live cursors use the same handle type and deliver copied
 * historical matches first, then live matches discovered through the hot-tail
 * extension. The snapshot result cache is an invisible process-side
 * implementation detail; it does not add public cache API or change cursor
 * answers. Ranking and aggregation are snapshot-only. Live query conduit
 * output publishes owned hit deliveries through typed query-hit messages
 * without changing borrowed cursor-hit invalidation.

 * reads the record straight off the read-only sealed-shard mmap image through
 * the rocs mapped-view API. This is the API egress drains want: index to any
 * record, then step forward or backward at very little cost.
 *
 * The cursor is unfiltered: it visits every record in the snapshot boundary,

 *         copied snapshot boundary is no longer retained.
 *
 * @post This API is snapshot-only. It creates an internal snapshot view,
 *       drains it to a finite result, and closes the temporary cursor/view
 *       before returning. It never requests @ref N00B_QUERY_MODE_LIVE, never
 *       tails commits, and never starts live conduit output.
 * @post Plain ungrouped/unaggregated queries return result-owned hits that pin
 *       any required resident mapped shard until @ref n00b_query_result_close.
 *       Unranked record hits are returned in durable-position order.
 *       Grouped/aggregate queries return result-owned rows and structured
 *       notes; row/key/note values are copied scalar variants and do not expose
 *       raw mapped JSON/list/dict/buffer handles.
 * @post Aggregate rows are sorted by typed group-key tuple order. Missing
 *       group-by fields use @ref n00b_query_missing_t, JSON null uses
 *       @ref n00b_query_null_t, and both are distinct from every string value.
 *       Row aggregate values are ordered like the query's @c aggregates list.
 *       @c COUNT returns @c uint64_t, @c AVG returns @c double, @c SUM returns
 *       @c double when any numeric operand is floating-point and otherwise
 *       @c int64_t or @ref N00B_QUERY_ERR_RANGE on signed overflow. @c MIN and
 *       @c MAX compare numeric operands numerically, preserve the selected
 *       operand's variant type, and break numeric ties by durable position.
 *       Missing, null, boolean, string, and composite operands for numeric
 *       aggregates are skipped and recorded as structured notes. @c limit is
 *       applied after row ordering.
 * @post Queries with @c ranked == true or non-empty @c boosts and no grouped
 *       or aggregate output score result-owned hits using scoreable positive
 *       whole-token @c contains leaves. Scoreable terms use mapped
 *       document-frequency stats and retained snapshot record counts; term
 *       frequency is not stored or counted, and duplicate occurrences in one
 *       record do not increase score. Ranked record results sort by descending
 *       score with durable-position tie-breaks, then apply @c limit. Limited
 *       ranked runs are answer-equivalent to unbounded ranked execution on the
 *       same snapshot followed by truncation. Field boosts default to @c 1.0.
 *       Non-scoreable predicates still filter but do not fabricate score.
 *       Grouped/aggregate results combined with ranking or boosts return
 *       @ref N00B_QUERY_ERR_NOT_READY in this phase.
