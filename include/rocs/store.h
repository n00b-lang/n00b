// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Seal-time schema watermark (n00b#202 / #223 / wax#686).
//
// A sealed shard records no schema identity, so "this field is declared indexed
// and this shard has no column for it" is ambiguous:
//
//   A. the field was declared when this shard sealed, and no record here
//      populated it            -> equality is exact-empty; scanning is waste
//   B. this shard sealed BEFORE the field was declared
//      -> records may populate it, no index was built; scanning is the ONLY
//         sound answer (#202)
//
// #223 (df904c03) closed #202 by making every such shard scan. That is sound
// and it is why all eleven non-kind field filters full-scan every sealed shard
// in 0.8.45 (wax#686): a measured 1.2s -> >240s on a 0.8.44-sealed store.
//
// #241 makes future shards self-describing by writing an empty descriptor at
// seal. It cannot reach a shard already on disk, and a sealed image -- and a
// visible sealed catalog entry -- are both immutable, so the verdict cannot be
// backfilled into them cheaply either.
//
// This watermark resolves case A vs B for the installed base using the one
// piece of vintage information a sealed shard DOES carry: its seal_ts, which is
// CLOCK_REALTIME epoch nanoseconds (rocs_store_epoch_ns -> n00b_capture_
// timestamp). A shard sealed at or after the moment the schema last gained an
// indexed field was written by a gateway that declared that field -- so a
// missing column means nothing populated it, and exact-empty is CORRECT.
//
// Derivation of the value, and why it is where it is:
//
//   n00b#203 (f0b06009) declared the four transient session-ref columns
//     TERM-indexed                          2026-08-14 16:43:13 UTC
//   wax c21ce091 first pinned a libn00b
//     containing it, so this is the earliest
//     a gateway could seal with the
//     declaration in effect               2026-08-14 17:55:24 UTC
//   >>> THIS WATERMARK                      2026-08-26 00:00:00 UTC
//   wax 1db77a29 pinned n00b#220 = the
//     0.8.44 pin                            2026-08-27 00:33:22 UTC
//   observed 0.8.44 crayon-gw build stamp
//     (n00b#264 field report, "0.8.44 /

//
// src/rocs/wax.c has been touched exactly twice, and #203 is the later of the
// two, so #203 is the last time the schema gained an indexed field.
//
// The two error directions are NOT symmetric, so the value is erred LATE:
//   too late  -> a shard that could have been trusted gets scanned. Costs
//                time. This is exactly today's behavior, so it cannot regress
//                anything.
//   too early -> a pre-declaration shard gets trusted, and equality on it
//                silently drops rows. That is #202 back again, and silent.
// The safe window here is ~12.5 days wide (2026-08-14 17:55 -> 2026-08-27
// 00:33). This sits 11.3 days up it: a pre-#203 gateway would have to have
// been still sealing 11 days after the declaration landed to be mis-trusted,
// while every 0.8.44-sealed shard clears it by at least 26 hours.
//
// This is a TRUST ASSERTION, not a proof. Wall-clock seal time does not prove
// code vintage -- a stale binary can seal at any time. The thing that would
// make it a proof is a per-shard schema fingerprint; the catalog already
// carries a schema_generation field for exactly this and it is inert (its only
// assignment is `store->schema_generation = 0`), which is tracked separately as
// the work that retires this constant. Deployments with a longer stale-binary
// tail than 11 days should raise schema_declared_since_ns at store open, or set
// it to zero to disable the trust entirely.

/**
 * @brief Open a SEALED-ONLY, optionally bounded record-stream cursor whose
 *        catalog slice is snapshotted under the store commit lock.
 *
 * The unqualified @ref n00b_store_record_stream_open publishes its per-shard
 * retention list only AFTER walking the catalog without the commit lock, so
 * retention can drop a sealed shard the walk is about to borrow, and it also
 * snapshots the mutable hot tail. This variant is for consumers that need
 * crash-consistent traversal (projection reducers):
 *
 * - The catalog slice, the stream's shard-id list (which retention consults
 *   to block drops), and the retention pin are all published while the commit
 *   lock is held, so no shard in the slice can be dropped between selection
 *   and use.
 * - Hot state is excluded entirely: only visible sealed shards are returned,
 *   which is exactly the crash-durability boundary.
 * - When @p through is non-NULL it must resolve to an exact visible sealed
 *   record; the cursor then ends at it (inclusive). If it does not resolve --
 *   aged out, quarantined, or never sealed -- the open FAILS with
 *   N00B_STORE_ERR_RETENTION rather than returning a short read.
 * - Records above @p after that were dropped or quarantined leave a gap the
 *   slice cannot represent, so the open fails with N00B_STORE_ERR_RETENTION
 *   instead of skipping them; only a watermark at or past a shard's last
 *   record treats that shard as consumed. Quarantine is detected from the
 *   catalog, so that refusal lifts if the shard is restored. Drops are
 *   detected via an in-memory mark of the newest dropped record, so the
 *   refusal is conservative (a drop above @p through also refuses) and does
 *   not survive a process restart: across restarts callers must prevent
 *   gaps -- hold a store pin over the unconsumed range, or retire shards
 *   only below the projection's persisted watermark. A NULL @p after makes
 *   no continuity claim: it re-baselines on the currently visible sealed
 *   state.
 * - The slice is delivered in ascending (generation, shard_id) order even
 *   though the catalog list itself is unordered, so a consumer advancing a
 *   monotonic applied-position watermark never skips records.
 * - No time-anchored fallback: a stranded position is the caller's policy
 *   decision, not a silent re-anchor.
