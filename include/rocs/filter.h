 * Filters are first-class process-side values. This header is intentionally
 * independent of stores, query execution, and the internal planner tree: callers
 * may construct values, named fields, the catch-all field identity, typed
 * paths, and immutable predicate nodes without opening a rocs store.
 *
 * `n00b_filter_value_t` is a n00b variant. The variant selector is the only
 * filter-value payload discriminator. This header does not define a public
 * filter-value type enum, cached payload type, node type, or manual value union.
