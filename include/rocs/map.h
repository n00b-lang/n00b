/**
 * @file rocs/map.h
 * @brief Low-level resident-image mapped access declarations for rocs.
 *
 * This header declares the WP-001 mapped access surface. Mapped views are
 * borrowed, read-only, resolver-aware handles over a resident marshal image;
 * callers must not cast them to ordinary n00b containers or pass mapped
 * internals to hot list/dict APIs.
 *
 * The resident-image contract is:
 * - @c image_base + (vaddr & 0xFFFFFFFF) resolves into the contiguous payload
 *   front after the marshal stream header.
 * - Trailing marshal metadata remains for shared marshal/unmarshal
 *   compatibility outside rocs, but rocs mapped readers never unmarshal shard
 *   images and do not apply or rewrite patch/scan records.
 * - Function-pointer patch slots may be zero in the payload front because code
 *   pointers are not meaningful in read-only resident images; ordinary pointer
 *   and static-data patch payload slots are preserved.
 * - While open, the resident image is registered with the runtime as findable
 *   but GC-opaque. The collector may classify pointers into the image, but it
 *   must not trace or rewrite image contents.
 * - Closing a map invalidates every borrowed shard/list/dict/slot/ref handle
 *   derived from it.
