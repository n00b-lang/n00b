/**
 * @file rocs/service.h
 * @brief Reference service configuration and runtime declarations for rocs.
 *
 * The reference service is a thin composition layer over the public rocs
 * store, query, HTTP, and conduit APIs. Service configuration composes a store
 * config profile plus service-local process options. Runtime startup requires
 * an application-supplied schema; the runtime keeps @c ROCS_SCHEMA as config
 * metadata while the reference CLI may use recognized schema ids to choose
 * that application schema before startup.
 *
 * Minimal reference HTTP protocol:
 *
 * - @c POST @c /v1/query accepts JSON:
 *   @code
 *   {
 *     "filter": { "exists": "id" },
 *     "limit": 10,
 *     "ranked": false,
 *     "include_records": false,
 *     "resume": "optional-durable-position-token"
 *   }
 *   @endcode
 *   The @c filter object supports @c {"exists":"field"} and
 *   @c {"contains":{"field":"message","term":"word"}},
 *   @c {"eq":{"field":"quality","value":"degraded"}},
 *   @c {"range":{"field":"timestamp","lower":1,"upper":2}}, and
 *   @c {"and":[...]} composition. The route constructs public filter/query
 *   specs. Unranked requests execute a bounded snapshot cursor page and return
 *   @c hits, @c count, @c more, and @c next_resume so callers can stream pages
 *   by sending the previous @c next_resume as @c resume. Ranked requests execute
 *   @ref n00b_query_run as a finite ranked query and do not accept @c resume.
 *   When @c include_records is true, each hit also includes a newly
 *   materialized JSON copy of the record.
 * - @c POST @c /v1/records accepts one JSON record body. Read-only services
 *   return a deterministic @c 403 response. Read-write services ingest the
 *   body through @ref n00b_store_ingest_buf without sealing the current hot
 *   shard.
 * - @c POST @c /v1/records/batch accepts newline-delimited JSON records.
 *   Read-write services ingest the batch through
 *   @ref n00b_store_ingest_buf_batch without sealing the current hot shard.
 * - @c POST @c /v1/flush seals pending writes through the public store API so
 *   later snapshot queries observe the write.
 * - @c GET @c /healthz/startup succeeds after config/schema/store open,
 *   route registration, and listener startup have completed.
 * - @c GET @c /healthz/live succeeds while the runtime is alive, including
 *   dependency outage or draining states.
 * - @c GET @c /healthz/ready succeeds only when the service is started,
 *   dependency-ready, not draining, and the underlying store is open.
 * - @c GET @c /metrics returns Prometheus text with stable rocs metric names
 *   for store residency/catalog state, resident-cache activity, live-pressure
 *   gauges, and request/error/latency counters.
 *
 * Responses never expose mapped JSON containers, mapped buffers,
 * catalog-entry pointers, resident handles, or query-cache internals.
