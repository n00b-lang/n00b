/**
 * @file naudit/languages.h
 * @brief Built-in language registry for naudit (WP-009 Phase 1).
 *
 * Naudit's per-file dispatch needs to know, for any audited source
 * file, which grammar to load and which tokenizer to invoke. That
 * mapping is owned by **naudit itself** — a hardcoded table of
 * supported languages plus their default file extensions. Project
 * rule files may override the extension set per language (via the
 * `@extensions` top-level directive parsed by `guidance.c`), but
 * they cannot redefine a language's grammar or tokenizer. Adding a
 * new language is a naudit-side commit, not a per-project concern.
 *
 * The Phase 1 registry has exactly one entry — `c` — pointing at
 * the vendored `c_ncc.bnf` (configure-time-baked
 * `N00B_AUDIT_GRAMMAR_PATH`) and at the `"c"` tokenizer in
 * `tokenizer_registry.h`. Future language additions (n00b, Python,
 * etc.) land here as new const-data rows.
 *
 * Per project DECISIONS.md D-006, the header filename is unprefixed
 * (`naudit/languages.h`); symbol-level prefix discipline (the
 * `n00b_naudit_` prefix matching WP-008's
 * `n00b_naudit_register_rule_file_tokenizer` precedent) is in
 * force. See `_kargs` discipline note on the lookup APIs below.
 *
 * Headers under `include/naudit/` may be #included standalone, so
 * this file pulls `<n00b.h>` defensively for the `n00b_string_t` /
 * `n00b_list_t` / `n00b_dict_t` declarations.

/**
 * @brief One row in the naudit built-in language registry.
 *
 * Populated lazily on the first registry lookup (see
 * `n00b_naudit_lookup_language_by_name`); the resulting list is
 * read-only after init.
 *
 * Field meanings:
 *  - `name`                short language name (e.g. `r"c"`).
 *  - `grammar_path`        absolute path to the language's BNF
 *                          grammar file (configure-time baked by
 *                          the meson build, e.g.
 *                          `N00B_AUDIT_GRAMMAR_PATH` for C).
 *  - `tokenizer_name`      key into the tokenizer registry (see
 *                          `naudit/tokenizer_registry.h`); same
 *                          string as `name` when the language and
 *                          tokenizer share a name.
 *  - `default_extensions`  file extensions associated with this
 *                          language out of the box, each carrying
 *                          the leading `.` (e.g. `r".c"`, `r".h"`
 *                          for C). Always non-null and non-empty
 *                          on a registered language.
