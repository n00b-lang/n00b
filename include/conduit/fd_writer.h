/**
 * @file fd_writer.h
 * @brief FD-writer conduit filter: subscribes to a buffer topic and
 *        writes buffers to a managed file descriptor owner.
 *
 * This is the terminal sink for the conduit pipeline.  Created by
 * `n00b_init()` for stdout (fd 1) and stderr (fd 2), and available for
 * user code to wire up additional managed fd outputs.
 *
 * After each successful managed owner write, the transform framework
 * publishes the originating topic pointer (`n00b_conduit_topic_base_t *`)
 * to the upstream topic's `done_topic`.  Synchronous writers subscribe
 * one-shot to that done topic and wait on the inbox CV.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * ```c
 * auto r = n00b_conduit_fd_writer_new(conduit, topic, 1);
 * // The filter runs its own thread; buffers published to `topic`
 * // are written to fd 1 (stdout) automatically.
 * ```
