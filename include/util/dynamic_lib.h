/**
 * @file util/dynamic_lib.h
 * @brief n00b-idiomatic wrapper over the POSIX dynamic linker.
 *
 * Replaces ad-hoc `<dlfcn.h>` use throughout libn00b consumers (most
 * importantly libn00b_aws's demangle-generated headers — see
 * [[project_n00b_aws_via_rust_shim]] in the SKP auto-memory). The
 * implementation in `src/util/dynamic_lib.c` is the single POSIX
 * boundary file; nothing else in n00b touches `dlopen` / `dlsym` /
 * `dlclose` directly.
 *
 * Two surfaces are exposed:
 *
 *   - n00b-typed (`n00b_dynamic_lib_open`, `n00b_dynamic_lib_symbol`,
 *     `n00b_dynamic_lib_close`) — for hand-written n00b code. Takes
 *     `n00b_string_t *` for paths and symbol names; returns
 *     `n00b_result_t(T)` so callers get either the value or an
 *     `n00b_dynamic_lib_err_t`.
 *
 *   - C-string boundary (`n00b_dynamic_lib_open_cstr` /
 *     `_symbol_cstr` / `_close`) — drop-in for code that already
 *     speaks the `dlopen` / `dlsym` / `dlclose` shape; in particular
 *     this is what `~/slop/bin/demangle` emits into its generated
 *     headers when invoked with `--loader-prefix=n00b_dynamic_lib`.
 *
 * Handles are opaque (`n00b_dynamic_lib_t`) and live in the n00b GC
 * heap with a finalizer that closes the underlying `dlopen` handle if
 * the caller never explicitly closes it. This means a loaded shared
 * library is unloaded when the last reference becomes unreachable —
 * the cstr boundary returns a raw `void *` for `dlopen`-shape
 * compatibility, but the pointee is the same managed structure.
