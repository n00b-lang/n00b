/**
 * @file util/worker_pool.h
 * @brief Bounded worker pool — generic producer/consumer primitive.
 *
 * A thread pool with a fixed worker count and a bounded ring of
 * pending jobs. Producers call `n00b_worker_pool_submit` from any
 * thread; workers pop jobs and invoke the caller's
 * `n00b_worker_fn_t`. Backpressure is built in: `_submit` blocks
 * when the ring is full, and workers block when the ring is empty.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - `n00b_worker_pool_new(size, cap, fn, user)` spawns `size`
 *     worker threads and arms the ring with capacity `cap`.
 *   - Per-job state should be heap-allocated (`n00b_alloc(T)`) by
 *     the producer so the GC tracks it; the pool stores `void *`
 *     entries and never copies job bytes itself.
 *   - `n00b_worker_pool_quiesce(pool)` blocks the caller until the
 *     queue is drained and no jobs are in-flight.
 *   - `n00b_worker_pool_shutdown(pool)` signals every worker to
 *     exit and joins all threads. Callers MUST quiesce first if
 *     they want already-submitted work to complete.
 *
 * Per D-002 (substrate placement): this lives in n00b/util rather
 * than in any single consumer, because the producer-consumer pattern
 * with bounded backpressure has broad value across the n00b
 * ecosystem (SKP's ingestion worker is the first consumer; future
 * services slot in identically).
