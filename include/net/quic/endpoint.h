/**
 * @file endpoint.h
 * @brief QUIC endpoint — UDP socket + picoquic context.
 *
 * `n00b_quic_endpoint_t` pairs a UDP datagram socket (via the
 * conduit's UDP primitive) with a picoquic context.  An endpoint can
 * both initiate outbound connections (always) and accept inbound
 * connections (when constructed in listen mode).
 *
 * ### What this does today
 *
 * Phase 1 (this revision) ships endpoint **lifecycle** only — create
 * and close.  The recv → `picoquic_incoming_packet` → `picoquic_prepare_next_packet`
 * → send loop lands in the follow-up that wires up the per-channel
 * APIs.  An endpoint created today is a real `picoquic_quic_t` bound
 * to a real UDP socket; it just doesn't yet drive packets through
 * picoquic.
 *
 * ### Listen vs initiate
 *
 * - **Initiate-only** (default) — the endpoint can call
 *   `n00b_quic_connect` to open outbound connections.  No cert / key
 *   required.  Trust store optional (defaults to system).
 * - **Listen** (`.listen = true`) — the endpoint accepts inbound
 *   connections in addition to initiating.  Requires `cert` and `key`
 *   secret handles.  *Phase 1 does not yet ship listen mode*; the
 *   constructor returns @c N00B_QUIC_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED until the
 *   secret-to-picotls bridge lands.
 *
 * ### Allocator discipline
 *
 * The endpoint and every long-lived object it owns (picoquic context,
 * UDP socket handle, etc.) live in the conduit pool.  Per
 * `docs/quic/allocator.md`.
 *
 * @see conn.h, chan.h, trust.h, secret.h

/**
 * @brief Create a QUIC endpoint backed by a UDP socket.
 *
 * Allocates a new endpoint, binds a UDP socket through the conduit's
 * UDP primitive, and creates a picoquic context wired to that socket.
 * The endpoint is the entry point for both outbound connections (via
 * @c n00b_quic_connect, follow-up) and accepted inbound connections
 * (via the topic returned from @c n00b_quic_endpoint_accept_topic,
 * follow-up).
 *
 * @param c   Conduit to register the endpoint's resources under.
 * @param io  IO backend for the UDP socket.
 *
 * @kw listen     Default: false.  Accept inbound connections in
 *                addition to initiating.  Requires @p cert and @p key.
 * @kw bind_host  Local bind address as a string (e.g., "127.0.0.1",
 *                "::").  Default: nullptr → IPv4 wildcard.
 * @kw bind_port  Local UDP port.  Default: 0 → ephemeral.
 * @kw alpn       NUL-terminated ALPN identifier (e.g., "n00b-echo/1").
 *                Default: nullptr → no ALPN advertised (rejected by most
 *                peers; set explicitly for production).
 * @kw trust      Trust store for verifying peer certs.  Default:
 *                nullptr → not yet supported (was: system store; that
 *                lands with picotls integration).
 * @kw cert       Server certificate handle.  Required if listen=true.
 * @kw key        Server private-key handle.  Required if listen=true.
 * @kw qlog_dir   Directory to write per-connection qlog files.
 *                Default: nullptr → disabled.  *Currently a no-op;
 *                qlog wiring lands with the qlog module.*
 * @kw lb_cid_config Optional QUIC LB-CID config
 *                (`include/quic/lb_cid.h`).  Default: nullptr →
 *                picoquic uses random CIDs.  Borrowed; must
 *                outlive the endpoint.  See
 *                [`security.md` § QUIC LB-CID](../../docs/quic/security.md)
 *                + Phase 5 § 5.8 for the deployment story.
 *
 * @return Result: ok with the new endpoint, or err on failure.
 *         @c N00B_QUIC_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED for listen=true at this
 *         revision.
 *
 * @pre @p c and @p io are non-NULL and registered together.
 * @post On success the endpoint owns a UDP socket allocated from
 *       the conduit pool and a picoquic context with default
 *       transport parameters.

 * @param chan    Target channel.  Must outlive the call; the I/O

 *       hand them to picoquic.
