/**
 * @file chan.h
 * @brief A channel — one stream on one connection, with framing semantics.
 *
 * `n00b_quic_chan_t` is the application-visible unit on top of a QUIC
 * stream.  It carries one of three semantics, fixed at open time:
 *
 * - @c FRAMED — Length-prefixed, type-tagged frames (see @c framer.h).
 *   Suitable for request/reply or message-stream protocols.
 * - @c BYTES — Raw byte stream.  No framing.  Useful for tunneling.
 * - @c DGRAM — RFC 9221 unreliable datagram channel (per-channel
 *   datagram semantics; not yet implemented in this revision).
 *
 * ### What this revision ships
 *
 * Phase 1 (this pass): channel **open**, **send** (with optional
 * FIN), **state** observation, and **close** / reset / stop_sending
 * primitives.  *Receive* — the path that fans picoquic stream events
 * into a per-channel topic — ships in the follow-up.  Without recv
 * you can drive an outbound-only channel, which is a real (if narrow)
 * use case.
 *
 * ### Stream IDs
 *
 * Stream IDs are allocated by picoquic via
 * @c picoquic_get_next_local_stream_id; we do not pick them
 * ourselves.  Bidi vs uni and even/odd parity are handled per
 * RFC 9000.
 *
 * @see conn.h, framer.h, quic_types.h

 * @brief Open a channel on a connection.
