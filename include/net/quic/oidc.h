/**
 * @file oidc.h
 * @brief OpenID Connect discovery + JWKS cache.
 *
 * Phase 3 § 7: discover an IdP's signing keys via the well-known
 * configuration endpoint and cache the JWKS with a TTL.  Wraps the
 * lower-level `n00b_jwt_verifier_t` from `quic/jwt.h` so callers
 * can verify tokens without writing a key resolver themselves.
 *
 * Discovery sequence:
 *
 *   1. Issuer URL `https://idp.example` →
 *      GET `https://idp.example/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
 *   2. Parse `jwks_uri` from the JSON response.
 *   3. GET that URL; parse as a JWKS.
 *
 * The JWKS is cached by `kid`.  RFC 7517 § 4.5: when a token's
 * `kid` is absent from the cache, refresh ONCE before failing —
 * this handles the "IdP rotated keys, new kid in the wild"
 * case.  After TTL, the next access refreshes lazily.
 *
 * Trust path: discovery + JWKS GETs use the same OS-trust
 * verification as the ACME shim (Phase 2 § 5.3).  No
 * `--insecure`, no `verify=false`.
 *
 * @see ~/dd/quic_3.md § 7
