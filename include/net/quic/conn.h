/**
 * @file conn.h
 * @brief A QUIC connection — one peer, one TLS session, many channels.
 *
 * `n00b_quic_conn_t` wraps one `picoquic_cnx_t` plus the n00b-side
 * lifecycle and lock state.  Connections are owned by an endpoint;
 * an endpoint may host many connections concurrently (typical client
 * usage is one connection per peer; a server endpoint accepts many).
 *
 * ### What this revision ships
 *
 * Phase 1 (this pass): outbound `n00b_quic_connect`, ordered
 * `n00b_quic_close`, observable state machine, snapshot stats.
 * Inbound accept and the per-connection cert/auth surfaces ship
 * once the secret-to-picotls bridge lands.
 *
 * Channels (`n00b_quic_chan_t`) ride on top of connections; their
 * API ships in the follow-up that wires picoquic stream callbacks
 * to topics.  Without channels, a connection is a handshake-only
 * object — useful for testing the transport, not yet for moving
 * application bytes.
 *
